| :---------- | :------------------------ |
| Tube Wells | 42%                        |
| Canals     | 30%                        |
| Wells      | 24%                        |
| Ponds      | 1%                        |

## **Classification of Irrigation Projects**

*   Based on the irrigated area, irrigation projects are divided into 3 parts:

|   Project Type   | Area (Hectares) |
| :--------------- | :-------------- |
| Small Irrigation Projects | 0-2000           |
| Medium Irrigation Projects| 2000-10,000      |
| Large Irrigation Projects | 10,000 or more  |

*   **Note:** Small irrigation projects contribute the most to irrigation in Rajasthan.

## **Multipurpose Projects**

*   Projects that have two or more objectives are called multipurpose projects.
    *   Example: Irrigation, drinking water supply, hydroelectricity.

**Page 109**

*   **Note:** Nehru called multipurpose projects the temples of modern India.
