|  Minerals  |  81 Types | 1st (Jharkhand)   |   | 1st- Odisha II - 4 Chhattisgarh   |

* **Note:** Total minerals produced in Rajasthan = 58

**(a) Mineral Diversity:** "Rajasthan has the highest mineral diversity in the country. For this reason, Rajasthan is called the 'Museum of Minerals'."
* A total of 81 types of minerals are stored in Rajasthan.

**(b) Mineral Storage:** The highest mineral storage in Rajasthan is in the Aravali, for this reason, the Aravali is called the 'Storehouse of Minerals'.

**Page 140**

**(c) Mineral Production:** Rajasthan's contribution to the total mineral production of the country - 20%
        *   Metallic - 15%
        *   Non-Metallic - 25%
        *    Other - 60%
    *   **Note:** Rajasthan ranks first in the country in non-metallic mineral production.

**(d) Mineral Revenue:** Rajasthan ranks third in the country in terms of mineral revenue, because valuable non-metallic minerals are produced in Rajasthan.
    *   Ex: Petroleum, Granite, Marble

## **2. Mineral Rocks**
