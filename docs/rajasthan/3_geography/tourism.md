         *   Conclusion
### **A. UNESCO** (United Nations Educational, Scientific Cultural Organization)
        *  Establishment: 16 Nov 1945 (London, UK)
          *  Headquarters: Paris, France
         *  India became a member of UNESCO in 1946.
### **B. Concept of Geopark and Geo-Heritage Site**
     * The UNESCO Geopark and Geo Heritage Site concept are as follows:

     UNESCO
   *  Mentioned Geo-Park  Geo-Heritage Site

**Page 13**
*   **Rajasthan ka Bhugol**
**(a) Global Geo Park:**
  * **What is Geo Park?**
      *   The concept of "Geo Park" was given by UNESCO in 2001.
      *   It is a single integrated geographic area where sites and landscapes of international geo-scientific importance are managed by UNESCO with the overall concepts of protection, education, and sustainable development.
      * Under the bottom-up approach, local communities (landowners, community groups) and tourism service providers are involved in the "sustainable development and conservation" of these sites.
  *  **Currently in Geo Parks:**
       *  Till date UNESCO has given the status of "Global Geo Park" to 193 regions of 48 countries.
         *   At present, the first proposed geo park in India, 'Lamheta Ghat', will be established in Madhya Pradesh; this site is famous for dinosaur fossils and geological structures.
*   **Is the Geo Park Post Permanent?**
         *   UNESCO gives the status of 'Global Geo-Park' to a site for 4 years.
           *   The activities and quality of the Geo Park are re-evaluated after 4 years.
           *   A field mission is run by 2 evaluators to assess the quality of the UNESCO Global Geo Park.
            * After this mission, the evaluators prepare a "Progress Report" on the Global Geo Park, based on which a card is issued.
**Page 279**
*  **Rajasthan ka Bhugol**
###  **Hap Card:**
  *  (After fulfilling the standards) Included in the Geo Park list again for 4 years

### **Yellow Card**
 * (If it does not meet the standards) then you will be informed to take appropriate steps.
###  **Red Card**
    *   If the standards are not met within 2 years after the yellow card, then it will automatically lose the status of 'Geo Park'.
 *   There are four basic features of a UNESCO Geo Park:
       *(i) Geological heritage site of global level: It is necessary for a site to become a geo-park that the site is a site of geo-scientific importance at the international level.*
       *(ii) Management: The management of the Geo Park will be done by a local scientific organization.*
      *(iii) Firmness: To promote sustainable local economic development through geo-tourism.*
      *(iv) Network: Exchange of natural and cultural sites at local as well as global levels.*

*   **Rajasthan ka Bhugol**
 6.  **Geo Heritage Sites:**
       * The concept of the World Heritage Site was adopted by UNESCO in 1972.

          *   Under this concept, UNESCO promotes the protection of natural, cultural sites and intangible arts.
   
           *  At present, 40 sites of India are included in the UNESCO "Geo-Heritage Site".
