Okay, here's the translated and formatted information from the provided text, organized for clarity:

# **Drainage System and Rivers**

*   <- In Rajasthan, the drainage system is divided into three parts based on the confluence:
    1.  Arabian Sea Rivers (17%)
    2.  Inland Rivers (60%)
    3.  Bay of Bengal Rivers (23%)

## **Characteristics of the Drainage System**

1.  The drainage system of Rajasthan is mainly based on the monsoon.
2.  The highest number of inland rivers in the country is found in Rajasthan because the desert is more widespread here.
3.  The Aravali is called the water-dividing line of Rajasthan because it divides the drainage system into two parts: rivers flowing into the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal.

    *   Rajasthan's contribution to the country's total surface water and river water is 1.16%.
    *   **Note:** Rajasthan's contribution to the country's total groundwater is 1.72%.

4. In Rajasthan's drainage system ->
    *   Main Basins = 15
    *   Sub-basins = 58

## **A. Arabian Sea Rivers**
    *   (i) Luni River
    *   (ii) Mahi River
    *   (iii) West Banas River
    *   (iv) Sabarmati River

### **(i) Luni River**

    *   <- **Origin:** Nag Hills (Ajmer)
    *   <- **Confluence:** Rann of Kutch (Gujarat)
    *   <- **Length:** 495 km (Length in Rajasthan: 350 km)
    *   <- **Catchment Area:**  "Apna Baja" (Trick)
        *   <- Ajmer, Pali, Nagaur, Barmer (Balotra), Jalore (Sanchore), Jodhpur
    *   <- **Tributaries:**

        *   Suki, Bandi, Khari, Jojari, Jawai, Sagi, Meethi, Lilri, Guhiya

        *   **Note:** The Bandi River is called the 'Chemical River of Rajasthan' due to the dyeing and printing industry.

2.  **Long Rivers of Rajasthan:**
       * (i) Longest river of Northern Rajasthan - Ghaggar
      *  (ii) Longest river in Western Rajasthan or Desert - Luni river
     *   (iii) Longest river of Southern Rajasthan / Tribal Area - Mahi River
       * (iv) Longest river of full Rajasthan / longest river in Rajasthan - Chambal River
*  Note: Longest river flowing solely in Rajasthan - Banas River
   
3.  **Order of Rivers by Length (Descending Order)**
   *Trick*
      *   Ch = Chambal = 1051 km
      *   M = Mahi = 576 km
      *   B = Banas = 512 km
      *   L = Luni = 495 km
