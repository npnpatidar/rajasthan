### PM-PRANAM Scheme (Promotion of Alternate Nutrients for Agriculture Management)

*   **Objective:** To incentivize States and Union Territories to promote the use of alternative fertilizers and balanced use of chemical fertilizers.
*   **Funding Mechanism:** 
    *   The scheme has no separate budget.
    *   It is funded through "savings of existing fertilizer subsidies" under the Department of Fertilizers.
    *   50% of the subsidy savings are passed on to the state/UT as a grant.
*   **Utilization of Grant:**
    *   **70% of the grant:** Can be used for asset creation related to the technological adoption of alternate fertilizers and fertilizer units at village/block levels.
    *   **30% of the grant:** Used for rewarding and incentivizing farmers, panchayats, and Self-Help Groups (SHGs) involved in awareness generation and soil health improvement.

### National Quantum Mission (NQM)

*   **Timeline:** 2023-24 to 2030-31.
*   **Nodal Ministry:** Department of Science & Technology (DST).
*   **Key Targets:**
    *   Develop intermediate-scale quantum computers with 50-1000 physical qubits.
    *   Establish satellite-based secure quantum communications over a range of 2000 km.
    *   Establish long-distance quantum communications with other countries.
    *   Develop inter-city quantum key distribution over 2000 km.
*   **Thematic Hubs (T-Hubs):**
    1.  Quantum Computing
    2.  Quantum Communication
    3.  Quantum Sensing & Metrology
    4.  Quantum Materials & Devices

### India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC)

*   **Context:** Signed via a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) during the G20 Summit in New Delhi.
*   **Participating Nations:** India, USA, UAE, Saudi Arabia, France, Germany, Italy, and the European Union.
*   **Corridor Structure:**
    *   **East Corridor:** Connecting India to the Arabian Gulf.
    *   **Northern Corridor:** Connecting the Arabian Gulf to Europe.
*   **Infrastructure Layers:**

| Layer | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Railroad** | Provide a reliable and cost-effective ship-to-rail transit network. |
| **Electricity Cable** | Facilitate regional energy grid integration and efficiency. |
| **Hydrogen Pipeline** | Enable the transport and export of clean energy (Green Hydrogen). |
| **High-speed Data Cable** | Enhance regional digital connectivity and data security. |

*   **Strategic Impact:** 
    *   Reduces transit time between India and Europe by approximately 40%.
    *   Lowers logistics costs and enhances trade in energy and digital data.
    *   Serves as a strategic alternative to traditional maritime routes like the Suez Canal.

### RBI Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Update

*   **Stance:** The committee decided to remain focused on "Withdrawal of Accommodation" to ensure inflation progressively aligns with the target.
*   **Key Policy Rates:**
    *   **Repo Rate:** 6.50% (The rate at which RBI lends to commercial banks).
    *   **Reverse Repo Rate:** 3.35%.
    *   **Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) Rate:** 6.25%.
    *   **Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) Rate:** 6.75%.
*   **Inflation Targeting:** The primary mandate is to maintain Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation at 4% with a tolerance band of +/- 2% (i.e., between 2% and 6%).
