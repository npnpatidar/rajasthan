The BrahMos missile can be launched from land, sea, and air.

* **Pakistan's Actions:** Pakistan's failure to close its airspace after the drone attacks is highlighted as a reckless act, increasing the risk of civilian aircraft being harmed if India retaliated.

* **Swaram Drone Attacks on India:** Multiple coordinated swarm drone attacks targeted various locations across India, including Pathankot, Akhnoor, Jaisalmer, and Amritsar.

* **Motives Behind Attacks:** Two potential reasons for the attacks were identified:
    * To inflict damage on civilian areas or military bases.

* **Swarms Drone Attacks:** The lecture notes mention that Pakistan, possibly in collaboration with Hamas, employed swarm drone attacks, overwhelming India's air defense systems by launching hundreds of drones simultaneously. The purpose of these attacks is to test and potentially disable the targeted nation's defenses.

* **Recent Swarm Drone Attacks on India:** The lecture notes mention recent swarm drone attacks in Pathankot, Akhnoor, Jaisalmer, and Amritsar. Two possible motives were discussed: causing damage and targeting specific locations.* **India-Pakistan Conflict & Retaliation:**
