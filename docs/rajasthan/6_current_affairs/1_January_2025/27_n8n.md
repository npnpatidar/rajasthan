Okay, here are the short notes in bullet points and tables, without missing any factual detail from the provided content, and avoiding excluded elements:

**General Automation Platforms**

*   **Terminology:**
    *   Zapier calls automations "zaps".
    *   Make.com calls automations "scenarios".
*   **Microsoft Product:**
    *   Power Automate is a Microsoft product.
*   **API Interaction:**
    *  Connecting to APIs often involves JSON data.
    *   Zapier and Make.com abstract away the JSON interaction with APIs.
    *  Many APIs are accessible through platforms like Zapier and Make.com.
    *  Some APIs (e.g., PayPal, QuickBooks) may be available but not through Zapier or Make.com.
    *   Using certain APIs may require more developer-level interaction.

**Platform Features**

*  **Workflow Building:**
    *  Platform uses drag-and-drop for adding nodes to workflows.
    *  Platform displays code, combining low-code and hard-coding.
    *  Workflows can be executed and contain multiple parallel processes.
*   **Data Handling:**
    *   Make.com allows data manipulation within workflows.
*  **Workflow Execution:**
   *   The described workflow checks for changes every minute.
   * The workflow adds drafts to a specified location (posts).
* **Testing & Debugging:**
   *   A "fetch a test event" function exists within API connection process.
   *  Test events return data in JSON format.

**Platform Specifics**

*   **Zapier:**
    *   Offers up to five free automations (zaps).
    *   Free plan has limitations on the number of steps.
*   **Make.com:**
    *   Offers two free automations (scenarios).
    *   Charges less than Zapier for a large number of automations (tens or twenties).
    *   Offers numerous templates, ranging in complexity.
    *   Workflows can involve multiple steps.
    *   Supports integration with multiple platforms (e.g., Twitter, Ghost).
    *   Has a desktop version and a cloud version.

*   **Power Automate:**
    *   Integrates with Microsoft applications (e.g., Outlook, OneDrive, Teams).

**API Connections**

*   **Notion API:**
    *   Requires creating an API key for connection.
    *   Notion provides API documentation.
    *   Notion API code is displayed in JSON format.
    *   Offers more functionality than Zapier or Make.com.
    *   Involves creating an API connection and sharing your database with the connection.
*   **Other APIs:**
   *  Platform allows connection to the Ghost API.
    *   Allows connection to various services including PayPal and QuickBooks.
    *   Some APIs accessible through this method are not available on Zapier or Make.com.

**Software Versions & Cost**

* **Software Versions**
    *  Software has a desktop version.
    * Software has a cloud version.
* **Cloud Version Cost**
    * Cloud version costs $20 per month.
