## International Relations: UN Security Council (UNSC) Reform

*   Discussions are ongoing regarding the urgent need to expand and reform the composition of the UNSC to better reflect current global power structures and geopolitical realities.
*   **Primary Conflict Point:** The retention of veto power by the five permanent members (P5: China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, United States) remains the most significant obstacle to comprehensive reform.
*   **Key Demands for Expansion:** Proposals advocate for an increase in both permanent and non-permanent seats.
*   **G4 Nations Proposal:**
    *   A group comprising India, Brazil, Japan, and Germany actively campaigns for permanent membership, citing their economic size, geopolitical influence, and commitment to UN principles.
*   **Uniting for Consensus (UFC) Group:** This counter-group, led by nations like Pakistan, South Korea, Italy, and Mexico, opposes the addition of new permanent members but supports increasing non-permanent seats with longer terms.
