## Global Technology Governance: AI Regulation Frameworks

The global landscape is shifting toward risk-based regulation for Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies.

*   **European Union (EU) AI Act:**
    *   Adopted as the world's first comprehensive legal framework for AI.
    *   Applies a strict, four-tier risk classification system:

| Risk Level | Description | Example Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unacceptable** | Systems deemed a clear threat to fundamental rights (e.g., social scoring by governments). | **Banned** |
| **High** | Systems impacting critical infrastructure, legal decisions, education, or employment. | Mandatory conformity assessments and strict data quality requirements. |
| **Limited** | Systems requiring transparency regarding their AI nature. | Chatbots; Deepfakes (must be labelled). |
| **Minimal/Low** | AI systems posing minimal or no risk to citizens. | General spam filters; basic video games. |

*   **India’s Regulatory Approach:**
    *   Focus remains on creating a framework under the proposed Digital India Act (DIA).
    *   Emphasizes "Responsible AI" deployment rather than stringent bans on specific applications.
    *   Key priorities include user safety, data privacy, and mandatory accountability for organizations deploying high-impact AI systems.

## Economic Affairs: Oil Market Dynamics

*   **OPEC+ Strategy:** The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) agreed to extend major voluntary oil production cuts (totaling 3.66 million barrels per day) until the end of 2024.
*   **Rationale:** The cuts are intended to stabilize global oil prices amid concerns about lower-than-expected demand growth and rising non-OPEC production (primarily from the US and Canada).
*   **US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR):** The US continues efforts to replenish the SPR following significant releases in 2022, injecting stability into domestic energy markets.
*   **Inflation Impact:** High energy costs continue to exert upward pressure on global core inflation rates, impacting central bank monetary policy decisions.
