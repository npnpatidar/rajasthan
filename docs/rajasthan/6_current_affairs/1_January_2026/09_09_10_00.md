### Global Economic Policy and Trade Mechanisms

#### Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) - European Union

*   **Objective:** To prevent 'carbon leakage' (companies moving production to countries with lax climate policies) and ensure imported goods meet the environmental standards applied to EU domestic production.
*   **Scope:** Targets carbon-intensive imports, including iron, steel, cement, aluminum, fertilizers, electricity, and hydrogen.
*   **Timeline:**
    | Phase | Start Date | Requirement |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | Transitional | October 1, 2023 | Reporting obligations only (no financial adjustment). |
    | Full Implementation | January 1, 2026 | Financial adjustment based on embedded carbon emissions. |

#### G7 Summit Outcomes (Recent Meeting)

*   **Supply Chains:** Commitment to diversifying critical mineral supply chains away from single-source nations through enhanced partnerships and multilateral agreements.
*   **PGII (Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment):** Reaffirmed target of mobilizing $600 billion by 2027 for sustainable infrastructure projects in developing nations, focusing on clean energy and digital connectivity.
*   **Sanctions Coordination:** Agreed upon stricter enforcement mechanisms for existing sanctions regimes targeting specific nations involved in current conflicts, focusing particularly on financial loopholes and technology transfers.

### Domestic Economy and Demographic Shifts

#### Central Bank Monetary Policy Review

*   **Rate Decision:** Benchmark interest rates were maintained at 6.5% for the sixth consecutive review period.
*   **Inflation Assessment:** Core inflation remains elevated at 4.8%, resisting the desired target range. This persistence necessitated the current pause.
*   **Forward Guidance:** Rate easing is contingent upon a sustained decline in headline inflation and evidence of GDP growth stabilization in the forthcoming second fiscal quarter (Q2) figures.
*   **Liquidity:** The central bank will continue using variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) auctions to absorb surplus liquidity from the banking system.

#### Key Findings of the UN World Population Report

*   **Median Age Increase:** The global median age is rising rapidly, moving from 27 in 2020 to a projected 34 by 2050, largely due to declining global fertility rates (currently averaging 2.3 births per woman).
*   **Policy Implications:** This demographic shift demands significant reallocation of public expenditure toward:
    *   Geriatric care infrastructure and specialized healthcare services.
    *   Comprehensive reforms of existing pension and social security systems to ensure long-term solvency.
    *   Investment in technological solutions to enhance productivity among a shrinking working-age population.
