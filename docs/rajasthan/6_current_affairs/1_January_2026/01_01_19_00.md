## Global Energy Security and Diplomacy

*   Focus shifted to stabilizing global crude oil prices by coordinating releases from strategic petroleum reserves, primarily in response to ongoing geopolitical disturbances in key supply regions.
*   Discussions included the expansion of the "Green Transition Fund (GTF)," allocating significant financial resources for climate adaptation and renewable energy infrastructure development in emerging economies over the next five-year cycle.
*   Member states affirmed commitment to the "Digital Services Tax" framework aimed at ensuring equitable taxation of multinational tech corporations, pending ratification by the end of Q4.

| Diplomatic Outcome Area | Key Action / Agreement | Timeline / Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Food Security** | Pledges made to increase grain exports to drought-affected regions by 15% via designated humanitarian corridors. | Immediate (Next 60 days) |
| **Cyber Warfare** | Establishment of a joint task force to standardize protocols for attribution and response to state-sponsored malicious cyber activity. | Operational Q3 |
| **Rare Earth Minerals** | Agreement to diversify sourcing chains to mitigate supply concentration risks and stabilize prices for strategic manufacturing inputs. | Long-term strategy |

## Domestic Fiscal and Monetary Policy

*   The central bank maintained the inflation targeting band at 4% ± 2%, citing persistent supply-side cost push pressures, necessitating a cautious and data-dependent approach to monetary easing.
*   Implementation of the second phase of the "Productivity Linked Incentive (PLI 2.0)" scheme, specifically targeting advanced manufacturing sectors such as specialized chemicals, semiconductor fabrication, and aerospace components.
*   Revised guidelines for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) simplified approval processes for non-sensitive sectors, intending to boost capital inflows by 10% year-over-year.
