**Geopolitical Update: Red Sea Maritime Security and Trade Impact**

*   **Conflict Driver:** Continued drone and missile attacks orchestrated by the Houthi movement targeting commercial vessels in the Bab al-Mandeb Strait and Gulf of Aden.
*   **Response:** Formation of a multinational naval coalition (Operation Prosperity Guardian) led by the U.S. to ensure freedom of navigation.
*   **Economic Impact:**
    *   A significant percentage of global container shipping has been diverted around the Cape of Good Hope (South Africa).
    *   This detour adds an average of 10–14 days to transit times between Asia and Europe.
    *   Increased insurance premiums (war risk surcharge) for vessels entering the high-risk area.
    *   Observed drop in revenue for the Suez Canal Authority due to rerouting.

**National Infrastructure Initiative: Green Energy Transition Scheme (GETS-2025)**

*   **Objective:** To accelerate the integration of renewable energy sources into the national grid and modernize transmission infrastructure.
*   **Key Pillars of GETS-2025:**
    1.  **Distributed Generation:** Mandating rooftop solar capacity for all new commercial infrastructure projects over 5,000 sq. meters.
    2.  **Grid Hardening:** Allocation of $5 billion for smart grid technology implementation in coastal regions highly susceptible to climate events.
    3.  **Storage Capacity:** Incentivizing the establishment of four large-scale Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS) facilities by 2029.
*   **Funding Mechanism:** A blend of central government grants (70%) and private Public-Private Partnership (PPP) investment (30%).

**Economic Policy Review: Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Decisions**

*   **Policy Rate Status:** The MPC unanimously decided to maintain the existing Repo Rate at 6.5%.
*   **Rationale for Rate Hold:**
    *   **Inflation Target:** Although CPI inflation is trending downwards, core inflation remains sticky, necessitating a cautious approach.
    *   **Growth Projections:** Current GDP growth forecasts remain robust (projected 6.8% for the fiscal year), supporting the decision to prioritize inflation stability over stimulating further growth.
    *   **Liquidity Management:** The central bank will continue using Variable Rate Reverse Repo (VRRR) auctions to absorb excess systemic liquidity.

**International Appointments and Reports**

*   **New Leadership:** Dr. Elara Vasant appointed as the head of the International Technology Standards Body (ITSB), effective Q3 of the current fiscal year.
*   **Global Health Report (WHO):**
    *   Report highlighted a 15% increase in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) mortality globally over the last five years.
    *   The primary recommendation focused on national implementation of stricter regulations on trans-fats and high-sodium processed foods.
*   **World Trade Organization (WTO) Dispute Resolution:** A ruling was issued favoring Country A against Country B regarding steel dumping allegations, recommending compensatory tariffs be lifted within 90 days.
