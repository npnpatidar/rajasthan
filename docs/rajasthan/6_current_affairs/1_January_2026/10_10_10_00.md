**Red Sea Maritime Security Crisis**

*   **Location of Disruption:** Bab-el-Mandeb Strait (Crucial gateway for shipping accessing the Suez Canal).
*   **Perpetrator:** Yemen-based Houthi group.
*   **Tactics:** Deployment of drones and missiles targeting international commercial vessels.
*   **Stated Motivation:** Attacks are claimed to be in solidarity with groups involved in the Gaza conflict.
*   **Economic Consequences:**
    *   Significant rise in maritime insurance premiums.
    *   Major supply chain delays as ships reroute around Africa (via the Cape of Good Hope).
    *   Contributes to global inflationary pressure due to increased shipping costs and transit times.
*   **International Response:** Formation of the U.S.-led multi-national naval task force, 'Operation Prosperity Guardian' (OPG), aimed at securing the shipping lanes.

**India-EFTA Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA)**

*   **EFTA Member Nations:** Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.
*   **Nature of Agreement:** Free Trade Agreement (FTA) framework focusing on economic cooperation and investment.
*   **Key Commitments by EFTA:**
    *   **Investment:** Commitment to invest $100 billion in India over the next 15 years.
    *   **Employment:** Target goal of creating 1 million jobs in India through this investment.

| :--- | :--- |
| **India** | Increased market access for major exports (e.g., pharmaceuticals, textiles). |
| **EFTA** | Duty concessions and reduced tariffs on high-tech goods and specialized machinery imported into India. |

**Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Synthesis Report Findings**

*   **Warming Threshold Projection:** The 1.5°C global warming limit is projected to be breached significantly earlier than previously modeled, potentially by 2035, without immediate, deep emissions cuts.
*   **Irreversible Impacts Highlighted:**
    *   Projected irreversible melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS).
    *   Anticipated global sea-level rise of 3 feet by 2100 driven largely by WAIS melt.
*   **Regional Weather Impacts (South Asia):** Anticipated increase in the frequency and intensity of "wet-bulb" temperature events, posing severe risks to public health and severely reducing labor productivity during warm months.
