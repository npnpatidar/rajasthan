## Current Affairs Summary

### I. Geopolitical Shifts: Indo-Pacific Dynamics

*   **Quad Summit Focus:** Primary agenda items centered on maritime security protocols and supply chain resilience across member nations (US, Japan, Australia, India).
*   **Malabar Exercise Enhancement:** Agreement reached to increase complexity and frequency of joint naval drills to counter non-traditional security threats, specifically piracy and illicit trafficking.
*   **Economic Strategy:** Discussion emphasized the diversification of critical mineral sourcing and the establishment of "trusted technology corridors" to reduce dependency on single manufacturing hubs.
*   **Infrastructure Financing:** Commitment reaffirmed for transparent, high-standard infrastructure investment via the Blue Dot Network, focusing particularly on island nations facing climate vulnerability.

### II. Global Economic Trends: Inflation and Interest Rates

*   **Core Inflation Persistence:** While headline inflation rates showed marginal dips in Q3, core inflation (excluding energy and food) remains sticky, driven primarily by elevated service sector wages.
*   **Central Bank Stance:** Major central banks (e.g., Fed, ECB) signaled a cautious approach, maintaining higher-for-longer interest rate projections despite recession risks, prioritizing inflation containment.
*   **Debt Servicing Pressure:** Rising interest rates are increasing sovereign debt servicing costs, particularly affecting emerging economies that hold large volumes of dollar-denominated debt.
