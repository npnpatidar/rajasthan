## Global Geopolitics: The Semiconductor Supply Chain

*   **Market Context:** The global semiconductor industry is projected to exceed **$1 trillion** in annual revenue by 2030, fueling advancements in AI, defense technology, and 5G/6G infrastructure.
*   **Geographic Concentration:**
    *   **Advanced Logic Chips:** Over 90% of the world’s most advanced sub-10nm chips are currently manufactured in Taiwan (predominantly by TSMC).
    *   **Vulnerability:** This concentration poses a significant supply chain risk, sensitive to geopolitical tension (e.g., Taiwan Strait conflict) and environmental hazards.
*   **Strategic Policy Responses:**

| Initiative | Region/Country | Primary Goal | Key Mechanism/Budget |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CHIPS and Science Act** | USA | Reshore critical manufacturing capabilities. | $52.7 billion in subsidies for domestic fabrication plants (fabs). |
| **European Chips Act** | EU | Double regional market share to 20% by 2030. | €43 billion public/private funding mechanism. |
| **Semicon India Programme** | India | Establish a robust semiconductor ecosystem. | Focus on design-linked incentives (DLI) and Assembly, Testing, Marking, and Packaging (ATMP) units. |

*   **Export Controls:** Recent measures (e.g., US restrictions on exporting advanced GPU chips and related manufacturing equipment) aim to limit technological parity with strategic competitors in critical AI development.

## Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) and Financial Inclusion

*   **Definition:** DPI refers to interoperable, foundational technology layers (Identity, Payments, Data Exchange) that allow governments and the private sector to deliver services at scale.
*   **Key Components (The India Stack Model):**
    1.  **Identity Layer:** Biometric identity systems (e.g., Aadhar) providing universal identification.
    2.  **Payments Layer:** Instantaneous, low-cost payment mechanisms (e.g., Unified Payments Interface - UPI).
    3.  **Data Exchange Layer:** Secure, consent-based data sharing infrastructure (e.g., DigiLocker, Account Aggregator framework).
*   **Economic Impact of UPI:**
    *   Achieved a penetration rate processing over **10 billion transactions monthly** (peak 2023 data).
    *   Reduced transaction costs significantly compared to traditional banking and credit card networks.
*   **Global Expansion:**
    *   India is promoting the adoption of its DPI model—termed 'India Stack Global'—through bilateral agreements and collaboration with multilateral institutions.
    *   Target countries primarily include emerging economies in Southeast Asia and Africa seeking rapid financial inclusion solutions.
*   **Challenges in Deployment:**
    *   Ensuring robust data privacy frameworks (data residency, consent architecture).
    *   Bridging the digital literacy gap to ensure equitable access among diverse populations.
