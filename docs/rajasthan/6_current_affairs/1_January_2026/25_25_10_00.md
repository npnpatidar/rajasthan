### Global Semiconductor Supply Chain & Trade Controls

*   **US Export Restrictions:** The U.S. Department of Commerce introduced updated controls focusing on Advanced Computing Chips (ACCs) and associated chip manufacturing equipment (CME).
    *   *Objective:* To restrict the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) ability to acquire and manufacture high-end semiconductors necessary for advanced military technology, AI development, and supercomputing.
*   **"Small Yard, High Fence" Strategy:** Controls are highly targeted, impacting specific high-performance chip designs rather than broad sectors of the Chinese economy.
*   **Geopolitical Impact:** The measures mandate licenses for specific technology transfers, creating friction with key global chip manufacturers in allied nations (e.g., South Korea, Taiwan).
*   **Chinese Response (Rare Earths):** China countered the restrictions by imposing limitations on the export of critical rare earth metals, specifically **Gallium** and **Germanium**, essential inputs for semiconductor production.

### Indian Space Research (ISRO) Achievements

| Mission | Vehicle | Key Achievement | Date/Time |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Chandrayaan-3** | Vikram Lander, Pragyan Rover | Successful soft landing on the Moon's **South Polar region**. | August 23, 2023 (18:04 IST) |
| **Aditya-L1** | PSLV-C57 | Launch of India's first dedicated solar observation mission. | September 2, 2023 |

*   **Chandrayaan-3 Scientific Payloads:**
    *   **RAMBHA-LP:** Measures plasma density and variations near the lunar surface.
    *   **ChaSTE:** Conducts thermal property measurements of the lunar topsoil.
    *   **ILSA:** Monitors lunar seismic activity.
*   **Aditya-L1 Destination:** The spacecraft is positioned in a **halo orbit** around the Sun-Earth system's **Lagrange Point 1 (L1)**, approximately 1.5 million km from Earth, allowing continuous observation of the Sun without occultation.

### Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Monetary Policy and Payments

*   **Repo Rate:** Maintained the benchmark repurchase rate at **6.5%** for the fourth consecutive policy review.
    *   *Stance:* Remained focused on the withdrawal of accommodation to ensure inflation aligns with the target while supporting growth.
*   **Inflation Forecast:** RBI projected Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation for the current fiscal year (FY24) at **5.4%**.
*   **UPI Transaction Limit Expansion:**
    *   The maximum limit for UPI transactions in specific categories was raised from ₹1 lakh to **₹5 lakh**.
    *   *Applicable Categories:* Payments made to hospitals, educational institutions, and related services.
*   **Offline UPI:** Introduced guidelines for scaling up the UPI LITE functionality to enable small-value offline digital payments, promoting access in areas with poor internet connectivity.
