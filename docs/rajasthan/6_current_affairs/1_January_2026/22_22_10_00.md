## 50th G7 Summit Outcomes (2024)

*   **Venue:** Puglia, Italy.
*   **Key Focus Areas:** Artificial Intelligence (AI), security concerning the Indo-Pacific, sustainable development, and global economic resilience.
*   **Ukraine Aid:**
    *   Agreement reached for a $50 billion loan to Ukraine, financed by interest accrued on frozen Russian sovereign assets.
    *   The loan mechanism is termed the "Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) Loan."
*   **China Policy:** Member states committed to taking collective action to address China's non-market practices and industrial overcapacity, specifically citing electric vehicles and solar energy sectors.
*   **AI Governance:** Leaders agreed on the need for responsible AI development, emphasizing interoperability and human-centric approaches, building upon the foundations of the Hiroshima AI Process.
*   **Climate & Energy:** Reaffirmed commitment to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems by 2050, focusing efforts on reducing methane emissions and scaling up battery storage technologies.

## National Digital Infrastructure Mandate (NDIM)

The new infrastructure bill aims to streamline digital access and governance across rural and urban zones, effective Q4 FY25.

| Component | Objective | Implementation Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Broadband Equity Fund (BEF)** | Subsidize 5G connectivity deployment in regions currently lacking high-speed internet (defined as less than 50 Mbps down). | Public-private partnership model (PPP) with incentives for telecommunications companies. |
| **Data Localization Mandate** | Requires critical public data generated within the nation to be stored on servers physically located within national borders. | Introduction of specialized data centers certified by the National Cyber Authority (NCA). |
| **Digital Literacy Program (DLP)** | Training 10 million citizens annually in essential cybersecurity and digital transaction skills. | Collaboration with NGOs and educational institutions; standardized curriculum deployment. |
| **Spectrum Allocation** | Release of the 6 GHz band for unlicensed use to foster innovation in Wi-Fi and short-range communication technologies. | Auction and regulatory clearance expected within 18 months. |

## Global Deep-Sea Mining Regulations

*   **Focus of Discussion:** International Seabed Authority (ISA) meetings regarding the draft exploitation regulations for deep-sea mining.
*   **Key Minerals Targeted:** Manganese nodules, cobalt-rich crusts, and polymetallic sulfides found primarily in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the Pacific.
*   **Environmental Concerns:** Potential irreversible damage to unique deep-sea ecosystems, including disruption of hydrothermal vents and pelagic zones, and the creation of sediment plumes.
*   **"2-Year Rule" Invocation:** Nauru triggered the clause in 2021, compelling the ISA to finalize regulations or allow commercial exploitation to proceed under existing guidelines by July 2023.
*   **Current Status:** Regulations remain under negotiation. Several nations (e.g., France, Germany) have called for a moratorium or a "precautionary pause" until adequate environmental safeguards and impact assessments are scientifically verified.
*   **Technological Challenge:** Developing reliable monitoring and remediation technologies capable of operating effectively in high-pressure, low-light environments remains a major barrier to sustainable exploitation.
