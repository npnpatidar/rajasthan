**Geopolitical Focus: Maritime Security in the Red Sea**

*   **Key Trigger:** Increased drone and missile attacks launched primarily by Houthi rebels operating from Yemen since late 2023.
*   **Target:** Commercial vessels transiting the Bab al-Mandeb Strait, a narrow chokepoint connecting the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden.
*   **Impact on Shipping:** Major global container shipping companies (e.g., Maersk, Hapag-Lloyd) have diverted traffic away from the Suez Canal route.
*   **Alternative Route:** Vessels are rerouting around the Cape of Good Hope (Southern Africa).
*   **Economic Consequences:**
    *   Increased voyage distance (approx. 3,500 nautical miles longer).
    *   Significantly higher fuel costs and shipping insurance premiums.
    *   Delays in global supply chains, affecting delivery timelines for goods like crude oil, LNG, and consumer products.
*   **International Response:** Formation of a multinational naval coalition (Operation Prosperity Guardian) aimed at protecting commercial traffic in the region.

**Domestic Policy: Key Features of the Digital Competition Bill (Hypothetical)**

The bill aims to regulate large digital enterprises designated as "Systemically Important Digital Entities" (SIDEs) based on specific quantitative thresholds (e.g., market capitalization, user base).

| Provision Area | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Ex-Ante Regulation** | Mandatory compliance checklist for SIDEs; regulatory intervention occurs before anti-competitive behavior causes irreversible market harm. |
| **"Gatekeeper" Designation** | Entities classified as SIDEs must adhere to a strict list of dos and don'ts (obligations). |
| **Anti-Steering** | Prohibits dominant platforms from preventing business users from offering better prices or terms on competing platforms. |
| **Data Usage Restrictions** | Limits a platform’s ability to use non-public data collected from business users to benefit its own competing services. |
| **Interoperability** | Provisions mandating that SIDE platforms ensure reasonable levels of service compatibility with smaller competing services. |

**Global Economic Update: Central Bank Actions and Inflation Targets**

*   **Federal Reserve (US):** Maintained the Federal Funds rate in the 5.25%–5.50% range during Q1, prioritizing stability over immediate rate cuts due to persistent core inflation.
*   **European Central Bank (ECB):** Kept key interest rates steady. The deposit facility rate remains at 4.0%. Focus remains on bringing medium-term inflation back to the target of 2%.
*   **Inflation Trends (OECD Avg.):** While headline inflation has moderated significantly from its 2022 peaks, service sector inflation and wage growth continue to exert upward pressure on core inflation measures globally.
*   **Bank of Japan (BOJ):** Initiated the first interest rate hike in 17 years, raising the short-term rate from -0.1% to a range of 0% to 0.1%. This marked an end to its longstanding negative interest rate policy (NIRP).
*   **Reason for BOJ Shift:** Sustained evidence of positive wage-price spiral driven by strong annual wage negotiation results (Shunto).
