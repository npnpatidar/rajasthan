### Central Sahel Security Crisis

*   **Security Context:** The security environment has significantly deteriorated following recent regional political instability.
*   **Humanitarian Impact:** Aid deliveries face substantial access issues, contributing to the internal displacement of over 2.5 million people across the three most affected nations (Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger).
*   **Regional Response Shift:** Regional military blocs are increasingly exploring non-military solutions for stabilization.
*   **Proposed Non-Military Measures:**
    *   Increased investment in infrastructure development.
    *   Coordinated border patrol efforts.
*   **Challenge Recognition:** The shift acknowledges that purely military interventions have failed to effectively curtail the operations of armed non-state actors functioning within ungoverned territories.
