## Major Environmental Initiatives

*   **Green Credit Programme (GCP):** An innovative market-based mechanism designed to incentivize environmental action.

    *   Credits generated under GCP can be traded on a domestic exchange platform.

*   **National Green Hydrogen Mission:** Aims to establish India as a global hub for the production, utilization, and export of Green Hydrogen.
    *   Target: Achieve production capacity of 5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) by 2030.
    *   Projected investment: Over ₹8 lakh crore (approx. 100 billion USD).
    *   Expected outcome: Reduction of cumulative fossil fuel imports by over ₹1 lakh crore and abatement of nearly 50 million tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.

*   **Conservation Status Update:**
    *   **Project Tiger:** Completed 50 years of operation; reported the Indian tiger population has stabilized and is growing moderately in several key reserves.
    *   **Cheetah Reintroduction:** Efforts continue under the action plan to establish self-sustaining populations in the Kuno National Park, focusing on monitoring mortality rates and dispersal patterns.
