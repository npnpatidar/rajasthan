### European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)

*   **Mechanism and Purpose:**
    *   CBAM taxes imported goods based on the carbon emissions generated during their production.
    *   Designed specifically to prevent 'carbon leakage,' where companies relocate production outside the EU to avoid stringent EU climate laws.

*   **Implementation Timeline:**
    | Phase | Start Date | Requirement |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | **Transitional Phase** | October 1, 2023 | Importers must report emissions data (no financial penalties incurred). |
    | **Full Implementation** | January 1, 2026 | Duties will be charged based on reported emissions. |

*   **Initial Covered Sectors (High-Emission):**
    *   Cement
    *   Iron and steel
    *   Aluminium
    *   Fertilizers
    *   Electricity
    *   Hydrogen

*   **Global Impact:**
    *   Significantly impacts major EU trading partners, including China and India.

### Geopolitical Challenges in Antarctic Marine Conservation

*   **Governing Body:**
    *   The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), operating under the Antarctic Treaty System.

*   **Recent Outcome:**
    *   CCAMLR failed to designate three key proposed Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) at its recent annual meeting.
    *   The failure was primarily attributed to resistance and lack of consensus from member states, specifically Russia and China.

*   **Proposed Marine Protected Areas (MPAs):**
    *   East Antarctica MPA (1 million sq. km)
    *   Weddell Sea MPA (2.2 million sq. km)
    *   Antarctic Peninsula MPA

*   **Conservation Significance:**
    *   The proposed areas are critical biodiversity hotspots.
    *   They face increasing threats from climate change and unregulated fishing activity.
    *   The lack of designation underscores the significant geopolitical challenges involved in managing global commons regarding resource exploitation versus conservation.
