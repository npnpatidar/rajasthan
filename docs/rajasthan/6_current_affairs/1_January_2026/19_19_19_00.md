## Global Food Security and Trade Dynamics

*   **Supply Chain Disruptions:** Analysis indicates a 15% drop in grain output in the Eastern Europe/Black Sea region due to geopolitical instability.
*   **Buffer Stocks:** Several G7 nations have initiated rapid stock releases, primarily targeting relief efforts in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia.
*   **Trade Tariffs:** The recent G20 summit resulted in a preliminary agreement to suspend tariffs on essential medical and food supplies for the next 18 months to stabilize vulnerable markets.
*   **Climate Impact:** Persistent drought conditions in the Horn of Africa threaten livestock populations, requiring immediate international funding intervention estimated at $3.5 billion for resilience programs.

## National Manufacturing Incentive Scheme (NMIS 3.0)

This section summarizes the new production-linked incentives (PLI) designed to boost domestic output and reduce import dependency.

| Sector | Target Growth Rate (Y-o-Y) | Incentive Slab | Estimated Investment (USD Billion) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Electronics Assembly | 22% | 4-6% of Incremental Sales | 4.8 |
| Advanced Battery Storage | 18% | 8-10% of Ex-Factory Price | 6.1 |
| Textile (Technical Focus) | 15% | 3-5% of Net Production | 2.5 |

*   **Key Policy Shift:** NMIS 3.0 focuses heavily on high-value, intermediate goods production rather than solely finished consumer goods.
*   **Employment Projection:** The scheme is projected to generate 1.2 million direct and indirect jobs over the next five years, concentrated in 14 identified manufacturing hubs.

## Lunar Exploration Mission: Key Milestones

The recent successful lunar landing mission achieved significant technological and scientific objectives:

1.  **Soft Landing Validation:** Successfully demonstrated autonomous hazard avoidance during the final descent phase, ensuring a precision landing within 500 meters of the target site.
2.  **Rover Deployment:** The six-wheeled rover was deployed and traveled 101 meters in its first 72 hours of operation, collecting spectral data.
3.  **Water Ice Confirmation:** Confirmed the presence of significant concentrations of water ice molecules in the shaded regions near the South Pole using a newly developed laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) instrument.
4.  **Seismic Monitoring:** Installed a passive seismometer array designed to monitor moonquakes and analyze the geological stability of the lunar subsurface over a minimum operational period of one lunar day.

## Public Health Policy: Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)

*   **Focus Areas:** The new national strategy targets four main NCDs: cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes.
*   **Screening Targets:** Mandates an increase in primary care-level screening coverage for hypertension and diabetes among adults aged 30+ to reach 75% by 2027.
*   **Tobacco Regulation:** Implementation of stricter graphic health warnings and a 5% incremental annual tax increase on tobacco products to reduce usage rates by 10% nationwide.
*   **Infrastructure Investment:** Allocation of $1.5 billion for upgrading tertiary care hospitals to establish specialized NCD management centers in 45 priority districts lacking current adequate facilities.
