5.  **Rao Ranmal (1427-1438):**
    *   Married his sister, Hansabai, to Rana Lakha of Mewar.
    *   Was not satisfied with the Jojawar Jagir in Marwar and went to Mewar.
    *   In 1426 AD, captured Mandore with the Mewar army.
    *  Killed by Mewari nobles in 1438 AD with the help of his lover, Bharamali.

6.  **Rao Jodha (1438-89):** Son of Ranmal
    *   Succeeded in capturing Mandore in 1453 AD.
    *   Founded Jodhpur in 1459 AD and made it his capital.
    *   Built the Mehrangarh Fort on the Chidiyatunk hill in Jodhpur (Mayurdhwaj / Dhwaj Chintamani).
    *   Karni Mata laid the foundation of the Mehrangarh Fort (Ranmal's sister)
    *   The temple of "Chamunda Mata" was built in the Mehrangarh fort in 1460 AD.
    *   Queen Jasmade built the Ranisar Lake in Jodhpur.
    *   Jodha defeated the army of Sultan Bahlol Lodi of Delhi.
    *   According to historian Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha, Rao Jodha was the first powerful ruler of Marwar.
    *   His sons, Bika and Duda, established the states of Bikaner and Merta.

7.  **Rao Maldev (1531-62):**
    *   Father: Ganga.
    *   Mother: Padma Kumari (daughter of Jagmal Deora of Sirohi).
    *   Maldev became the ruler of Marwar after assassinating his father.

    *   At the time of his coronation, Maldev had only 2 parganas:
        1. Jodhpur
        2. Sojat (Pali): Where the coronation took place.

    *   He won 52 battles and 58 parganas. Some of them are:
         1. Phalodi: From the Bhattis of Jaisalmer.
          2. Bilara (Jodhpur): From the Sirvis.
          3. Nagaur: From Daulat Khan.
          4. Jalore: From Sikandar Khan.
           5. Siwana: Snatched from Dungar Singh.
           6. Merta: From Viramdev.
            7. Bikaner: Jaitasi.
             8. Raipur/Bhadrajun: From Veeran Siyal. (Pali) (Jalore).

    *   **Battle of Paheba/Saheba (1541 AD):**
        *   Maldev vs. Jaitasi (Bikaner).
        *   Jaitasi was killed in the battle.
        *   Maldev captured Bikaner and made Kumpa (commander) the administrator of Bikaner.
        *   Kalyanmal, son of Jaitasi, sought help from the Sultan of Delhi, Sher Shah Suri.

*  There was a dispute between Maldev and Viramdev (Merta) over 'Dariyajeda Halo', so Maldev captured Merta and Viramdev also went to Sher Shah Suri.

 * **Battle of Malhar (1557 AD):**
        Maldev vs. Rana Udai Singh (Loss)

*   **Maldev-Humayun Relations:**
    *   After losing to Sher Shah Suri, Humayun was passing through Marwar and sent three envoys from a place called 'Jaitojirth' to Maldev for help:
        1. Mir Samand
        2. Attaka Khan
        3. Raymal Soni

    *   Maldev gave a positive response and promised Humayun to give Bikaner and military aid.
    *   But Humayun could not trust Maldev and, on the advice of his librarian 'Mulla Surkh,' he went towards Sindh (betrayal).
    *   Raja Veersal Sodha of Amarkot gave shelter to Humayun.
    *   If Humayun and Maldev had shown a little understanding, they could have formed an alliance against Sher Shah Suri and ended Afghan rule in India.
    *  The relationship between the Mughals and the Rajputs started later by Akbar could have started at that time.

*   **Sher Shah Suri and Maldev Relations:**

*   **Battle of Jaitaran/Giri-Sumel (January 5, 1544 AD):**
        *   Maldev vs. Sher Shah Suri
           *  Jaita/Kalyanmal (Bikaner)
              *   Kumpa/Viramdev (Merta)

    *   Due to Sher Shah Suri's cunning, Maldev went to Jodhpur.
    *   Jaita and Kumpa fought against Sher Shah Suri.
    *   Sher Shah Suri won the war with the help of Jalal Khan Jalwani.
    *   After winning, Sher Shah Suri said: "I would have lost the sovereignty of Hindustan for a handful of millets."
    *   Sher Shah captured Jodhpur and handed it over to Khawas Khan.
   *  Maldev had gone to Siwana (Barmer).
        *  Siwana is the refuge of Marwar.
    *   After some days, Maldev recaptured Jodhpur.

    *  **Maldev made diplomatic mistakes in his relations with Sher Shah Suri:**
        1. He gave Viramdev and Kalyanmal a chance to go to Sher Shah. Otherwise, he could have formed a Rajput alliance against Sher Shah.
        2. If he had not fallen into Sher Shah's tricks, the "Battle of Giri-Sumel" would have been won.

*   **Umada:**
    *   Maldev's queen, daughter of Loonkaran Bhatti of Jaisalmer.
    *   Became angry with Maldev due to a maid named Bharamali. Hence, Umade is also called "Roothi Rani."
     * She spent some time at the Taragarh Fort in Ajmer.
        *  Later, she went to Kelwa (Rajsamand).
    *   **Jala:** A song sung by women when they go to see the camp of the marriage procession.

*   **Titles:**
    *  Pratap of Marwar (by Vishweshwar Nath Reu)
    *   Precursor of Pratap
    *   The Forgotten King of Marwar

### Similarities between Chandrasen and Pratap

*   Both did not accept Akbar's subordination.
*   Both followed guerilla warfare.
*   Both had to face opposition from their brothers.
  *  Like Jagmal and Sagar opposed Pratap, and Ram and Uday Singh were against Chandrasen.
* Both had to take refuge outside their state.
   *  Like Pratap took refuge in the field of Haldighati (near the Mali river), and Askaran, the ruler of Dungarpur, gave refuge to Chandrasen.
*   Akbar captured most of the states of both, but still, they continued to struggle with the strength of a small piece of land.

### Differences between Chandrasen and Pratap

1.  Pratap's opposition to the Mughals started with his coronation, but Chandrasen's opposition to the Mughals started after the Nagaur Darbar.
2.  Pratap's opposition to the Mughals continued even after his death through his son Amar Singh, but Chandrasen's opposition to the Mughals ended with his death.
3.  Pratap had a direct confrontation with Akbar, such as (i) the Battle of Haldighati (June 18, 1576 AD) and (ii) the Battle of Dewair (1582 AD). But Chandrasen could not do so.
4.  Pratap had established Chawand as his permanent center, but Chandrasen could not establish any such center.
5.  Pratap had spread unity and nationalist sentiments in Mewar, but Chandrasen could not do so.

*   Despite these differences, Chandrasen is called the Pratap of Marwar because:
    1.  Chandrasen's geographical conditions were unfavorable compared to Pratap, because Mewar was a mountainous region where guerilla warfare could be carried out for a long time, while Marwar was a flat desert.
    2.  Pratap received the support of philanthropic associates like Bhamashah and Tarachand, but Chandrasen lacked such support.

### Nagaur Darbar (1570 AD)

*   Organized by Akbar.
*   Objective: Famine relief work.
*   Immediate Objective: To get the kings of Rajasthan to accept subordination.
*   Harraj of Jaisalmer, Udai Singh (Chandrasen's brother) (Jodhpur), and Kalyanmal (Bikaner) accepted Akbar's subordination.
    *   During this, Akbar built the Shukra Pond (in Nagaur).

*   **Significance:**
    1.  The kings of Rajasthan accepted subordination through diplomacy without any war.
    2.  The kings of Rajasthan were divided into two parts: Mughal allies and Mughal opponents.
    3.  A chain of dependent kings was formed, such as Rai Singh of Bikaner and Man Singh (Amer).
