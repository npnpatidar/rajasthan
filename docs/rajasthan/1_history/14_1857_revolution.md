Here are detailed notes on the 1857 Revolution in Rajasthan, drawing on the information provided in the sources:

**Introduction** The 1857 Revolt in Rajasthan was a significant uprising against British rule, influenced by the broader Indian Rebellion of 1857. The princely states of Rajasthan had executed treaties with the British, gaining freedom from Maratha anarchy and ensuring safety from external powers. However, the British increasingly interfered in the internal affairs of these states, leading to discontent among rulers and the general populace.

**Causes of the Revolt in Rajasthan** Several factors contributed to the outbreak of the revolt in Rajasthan:

- **Political Causes:**
    - The **British policy of interfering in the internal affairs of princely states** created resentment among the rulers, whose condition became similar to feudal lords under the British East India Company.
    - The refusal of pension to **Nana Sahib**, the adopted son of Peshwa Baji Rao II, fueled anger.
    - The **Doctrine of Lapse** policy also caused dissatisfaction.
- **Socio-Religious Causes:**
    - **British social reforms** such as widow remarriage, abolition of Sati, education for girls, and the activities of Christian missionaries were perceived as interference in traditional customs and religion.
    - The introduction of the **Enfield Rifle** and the rumor that its cartridges were greased with animal fat (cow and pig) sparked outrage among both Hindu and Muslim sepoys.
    - New inventions like **railways and telegraphs**, and the spread of western education were also seen by some as threats to their traditional way of life.

**Role of Princely States** The rulers of the princely states in Rajasthan largely supported the British during the revolt:

- **Maharana Sardarsingh of Udaipur** was the first to help the British.
- **Maharaja Ramsingh of Jaipur** helped the British wholeheartedly.
- **Maharaja Takhat Singh of Jodhpur** was the ruler during the revolt.
- **Maharao of Kota, Ramsingh II**, was supported by Karauli against the rebels.
- **Maharaja of Bikaner** was the only ruler who went out of Rajasthan to help the British.
- **Maharana of Mewar** provided shelter to fleeing British officials.
- **Shahpura** gave refuge to rebellious soldiers from Neemuch and even arranged rations for them, refusing to open city gates to the British Political Agent of Mewar, Captain Shawers.
- **Tonk's Nawab Vajiruddaula** initially supported Tantiya Tope but later ordered the arrest of his own uncle, **Mir Alam Khan**, who openly opposed the British and led the rebel army.

**Important Revolutionaries of Rajasthan** Several individuals played crucial roles in the 1857 Revolt in Rajasthan:

- **Dungarji and Jawaharji** (uncle and nephew) were renowned patriots from the Sikar region who robbed wealthy persons to help the poor and fought against the British.
- **Kesari Singh Rawat** of Salumbar provided weapons, food, and shelter to rebels, including Thakur Kushal Singh and Tantiya Tope.
- **Amarchand Bathiya** of Bikaner was the first martyr from Rajasthan to be hanged during the revolt. He offered to donate his property to Tantiya Tope and is called the "second Bhamashah of Rajasthan".
- **Mir Alam Khan**, the uncle of the Nawab of Tonk, openly opposed the British and led rebel forces before being martyred.
- **Rawat Jodhsingh** of Kothariya (Mewar) helped and sheltered Thakur Kushal Singh and Tantiya Tope.
- **Jaidayal Bhatnagar** of Kota was a key organizer of the revolt there.
- **Mehrab Khan**, a Risaldar from Kota, worked with Jaidayal to incite rebellion.
- **Bhairosingh Jodha** of Gerao (Jodhpur) fought against General Lawrence's army and was martyred.
- **Heerasingh** fought against the British during rebel attacks and died fighting the Maharao's army.
- **Jiyalal** of Nimbahera (Chittorgarh) organized rebel battalions and fought to protect Chittorgarh before being arrested and shot.
- **Nabi Sher Khan** played a vital role in the Kota army's rebellion.
- **Munuvvar Khan**, a sepoy from Tonk, was martyred fighting the British.
- **Mohammed Khan**, a Risaldar from Kota, fought against the pro-British Maharao and was executed.
- **Sardar Ali** participated in the attack on the Kota Agency House.
- **Shakti Dan Thakur** of Asab fought against General Lawrence at Auwa and died in prison.

**Reasons for the Failure of the Revolt in Rajasthan** Several factors contributed to the suppression of the revolt in Rajasthan:

- **Support of Princely Rulers to the British:** The lack of support, and often active opposition, from the local rulers weakened the rebels. Lord Canning acknowledged the rulers' help as crucial in preventing a complete British defeat.
- **Lack of Leadership:** The rebels lacked a unified and able leader at the state level. John Lawrence noted that a single capable leader among the rebels could have led to a British loss.
- **Lack of Effective Command:** The rebels lacked efficient military commanders.
- **Limited Resources:** The rebels had fewer resources (wealth, food, weapons) compared to the well-equipped British forces.
- **Limited Spread:** The revolt did not spread throughout the entire state but was confined to certain areas like Nasirabad, Neemach, Kota, Erinpura, Jodhpur, and Dholpur.
- **Lack of Coordination:** The rebellions in different centers were not effectively coordinated.
- **Strategic Missteps:** The Nasirabad rebels directly went to Delhi. Had they instead focused on capturing the armory at Ajmer, the outcome might have been different.

It also notes that by **1818 A.D.**, princely states of Rajasthan started signing treaties with the British. These treaties initially provided relief from external threats but gradually led to increased British interference.

It involved various sections of society, from sepoys and nobles to common people, and produced notable heroes who stood up against colonial power. The failure of the revolt led to further strengthening of British control over the region.
