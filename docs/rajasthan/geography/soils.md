[Flowchart: Erosion, Sem, Salinity, Alkalinity, Soil Degradation]

### **1. Erosion**
    *   **Meaning:** The erosion of the upper surface of the earth is called "soil erosion."

**Page 137**
MAHECHA

*   **Causes of Erosion:**
        *   Excessive cutting of trees.
        *   Overgrazing.
        *   Unscientific agriculture (repeated cultivation).
        *   Mining

*   **Factors of Erosion:**
  *[Flowchart with labels: Air, Rainwater, River]*
*   **Types of Erosion:**
        *(i) Sheet Erosion (by air):*
          *  Most Common: West Rajasthan, Jaisalmer
         *(ii) Sheet Erosion (by rainwater)*
           * Sirohi, Rajsamand
         *(iii) Gully Erosion (by river water):*
            *   Chambal Basin
  
    *  **Note:** Main factor of erosion:
        *  Rajasthan = Air, India and the World = Water
        
*  **Solutions:**
        *   i) Afforestation
       * ii) Expansion of pastures
        *iii) Bunding of fields
        *   iv) Scientific mining
 *  Note: Erosion is called the "creeping death of soil" or "death of the farmer".

### **2. Sem / Water Logging (Jalakranta)**

    *   **Meaning:** The soil becomes marshy or the problem of moisture.

**Page 138**
MAHECHA
   *   **Cause:** Excess irrigation, water leakage
        *   **Affected Area:** Hanumangarh - Badopal, Sri Ganganagar
        *   **Solution:** Planting Safeda/Eucalyptus trees (Indo-Dutch Program) (India-Netherlands / Holland)
### **3. Salinity**
  *  **Meaning:** Due to excessive irrigation in arid areas, a white layer is formed.
       *    **Affected Area:** Sri Ganganagar, Hanumangarh, Bikaner, Jalore (Sanchore), Barmer.
    *   **Solution:**
        *[Flowchart: Fertilizer (Gypsum) method, Leaching]*
### **4. Alkalinity**
     * **Meaning:** The pH value of the soil being more than 8 is called alkaline.
       * **Cause:** Excessive use of chemical fertilizers/manures.
       *  **Solution:** Green manure of Guar and Dhaincha.
### **5. Soil Degradation**
  *  **Meaning:** The loss of physical, chemical and biological quality of soil is called 'soil degradation'.

**Page 139**

*   **Rajasthan ka Bhugol**
*   **Cause:** Excessive use of chemical fertilizers
*   **Solution:** Use of organic fertilizers
