## **Classification of Physiographic Divisions**

1.  **Individual Basis**
2.  **Geographical Factor Basis**

## **1. Classification on Individual Basis**

*   **According to Prof. V.C. Mishra**, Rajasthan is divided into seven physiographic divisions:

    1.  **Canal Region**
    2.  **Arid Region**
    3.  **Semi-Arid Region**
    4.  **Aravali Region**
    5.  **Eastern Agricultural and Industrial Region**
    6.  **Chambal Ravine Region**
    7.  **South-Eastern Agricultural Region**

## **2. Classification based on Geographical Factors**

*   Based on geographical factors (relief and climate), Rajasthan can be divided into four physiographic divisions:

    *   **Aravali**
    *   **Hadoti**
    *   **Eastern Plains**
    *   **Desert**

**Page 15**

## **General Information on Physiographic Regions**

| Feature    | **Desert**   | **Aravali** | **Eastern Plains** | **Hadoti**  |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| **Area**   | 61.11% | 9%     | 23%           | 6.83%   |

## **1. North-Western Desert**

*   Also known as the 'Thar Desert'.
*   **Formation:** From the Tethys Sea.
*   **Time Period:** Tertiary and Pleistocene Epochs.

*   **Note:** Current Epoch = Holocene

**Page 16**

### **Desert Extent**

*   **Area:** 1,75,000 km²
*   **Width:** 640 km
*   **Length:** 300 km
*   **Average Height:** 200-300 meters

*   **Desert Slope:** North-East to South-West
*   **Study of the Desert:** For study purposes, the desert is divided into two parts:

|   | **Arid Desert**       | **Semi-Arid Desert**|
| :---- | :------------------------ | :---------------------- |
| Rainfall | 0-25 cm per year     | 25-50 cm per year  |
| Area| 1,00,000 sq km  | 75,000 sq km |
*   **Arid Desert** - also called Rathi region because here Rathi cow is found.

**Page 17**

## **Arid Desert**

*   The area receiving less than 25 cm of rainfall is called the Arid Desert.
    * Divided into two parts for study purposes:
        1.  **Sand Dune Free Region:** 41.5%
        2.  **Sand Dune Covered Region:** 58.5%

1.  **Sand Dune Free Region:** An area where sand dunes are not found because it's a rocky desert called 'Hamada'.
    *   **Main Extensions of 'Hamada' in Rajasthan:**
        *   Jaisalmer (most) + Pokhran, Ramgarh, Lodrawa
        *   Jodhpur + Phalodi
        *   Barmer
2.  **Sand Dune Covered Region:**
    *   Meaning → Wind + Soil + Deposition = Sand Dune
    *   When wind deposits soil, the resulting landform is called a sand dune.
    *   **Highest Number of Sand Dunes:** Jaisalmer
    *   **All Types of Sand Dunes:** Jodhpur

**Page 18**

## **Types of Sand Dunes**

1.  Barchan
2.  Transverse Sand Dune
3.  Longitudinal Sand Dune
4.  Parabolic Sand Dune
5.  Seif
6.  Star-Shaped Sand Dune
7.  Shrub Coppies Sand Dune
8.  Network Sand Dune

1.  **Barchan:** Crescent-shaped
    *   **Height:** 10-80 meters
    *   When wind deposits soil in a crescent shape, it is called a 'Barchan'.
    *   **Most Common:** Shekhawati region (Bhaleri village of Churu)
    *   **Characteristics:**
        *   Most mobile and migratory sand dune; therefore, contributes greatly to desertification.

2.  **Transverse Sand Dune:** Formed perpendicular to the wind direction.

**Page 19**

4.  When the deposition of soil occurs at right angles by wind, the landform formed is called 'Transverse Sand Dune'.
    *   **Most Common:** Bikaner
    *   **Characteristics:** Most stable sand dune

5.  **Longitudinal/Linear Sand Dune:**

    *   Parallel to wind direction
         
        <---Wind
         ---> Wind

    *   When soil is deposited parallel to the direction of the wind, the resulting landform is called a 'Longitudinal / Linear Sand Dune'.
        *   **Most Common:** Jaisalmer
        *   **Note:** These sand dunes are also found near Budhi, Jawai, and Ghaggar basins.

4.  **Parabolic Sand Dune:**

          Wind —>
          Wind
          Opposite to Barchan

          <—Wind
    *   Parabolic sand dunes are formed opposite to Barchan and in a hairpin shape.
    *   Parabolic sand dunes are most common in Rajasthan because they are spread across all desert districts.

**Page 20**

5.  **Seif Sand Dune:**

    Wind  
      <—
    Barchan = Seif
     Wind

    *   When the wind direction changes during the formation of a Barchan, one arm of the Barchan extends forward, and the resulting landform is called a Seif sand dune.

   **RAS DTO**
      *Right Angled Sand Dune	Parallel Sand Dune
      *Transverse Sand Dune	Longitudinal Sand Dune
      *Barchan Sand Dune	Seif Sand Dune
      *Parabolic Sand Dune

6.  **Star-Shaped Sand Dune:** A landform with 3 or more arms is called a star-shaped sand dune.
    *   **Formation:** Due to irregular depressions
    *   **Most Common:** Jaisalmer, Suratgarh (Sri Ganganagar), Bikaner
       Wind
       <—
       <—Wind
       Wind—>

**Page 21**

7.  **Shrub Coppies:**
    *   Small sand dunes formed near shrubs in the desert are called Shrub Coppies sand dunes.
    *   **Most Common:** Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Barmer, Jodhpur
    *   **Note:** These sand dunes are also called 'Nebkha'.

**Page 44**

*   **The Banganga Plain is also called the Roohi Plain.**
*   **Extent:** Jaipur, Kotputli-Behror, Dausa, Bharatpur
*   **Soil:** Mostly alluvial soil is found.
*   **Specialty:** Maximum water exploitation is found in the Banganga Plain because it has the most fertile alluvial soil.

## **3. Chambal Plain**

*   The Chambal Plain is also called the "Bihad/Dang Plain".
    *   Badland Topography
    *   Gully Erosion

*   **Badlands created by the gully erosion of the Chambal are called 'Bihad'.**
*   **Extent:** Chittorgarh, Kota, Bundi, Sawai Madhopur, Karauli, Dholpur
*   **Soil:** Black alluvial soil is found.

## **4. Importance of Eastern Plains** (50 words)

*   **(i) Agricultural Productivity:**
    *   Agricultural productivity is higher in the eastern plains because the most fertile soil (alluvial) is found here.
*   **(ii) Population Density:**
     * It has a high population density because it is a fertile region.

**Page 45**

*   **(iii) Basic Infrastructure:** Basic infrastructure is more developed in the eastern plains, such as roads, electricity, transport, and education.
*   **(iv) Industry:** The eastern plain is more developed than other physiographic regions such as Jaipur and Alwar.
*   **(v) Bird Biodiversity:** More species of birds are found in the eastern plains.
    *   Ex: Keoladeo, Kachh Baritha

## **Other Important Points**

# **Hadoti Plateau / South-Eastern Plateau**

*   **Formation:** It is formed by basalt lava rocks.
*   **Formation Period:** Cretaceous Period
*   **Average Height of Hadoti:** 500 meters
    * Upper Hadoti
        (1) Cretaceous Plateau
    *   Southern Hadoti

## **Study of the Hadoti Plateau**

*   For the purpose of study, the Hadoti Plateau is divided into two main parts and three sub-parts.
*   **Main parts of Hadoti Plateau:**
    *   (i) Deccan Lava Plateau
    *   (ii) Vindhyan Scarps
*   **Note:** G.B.F [Great Boundary Fault]
    *   It is a fault located between the Aravali and Hadoti. It is included in the World Heritage site.
    *   **Extent:** Chittorgarh, Bhilwara, Kota, Bundi, Sawai Madhopur, Karauli, Dholpur
    *   GBF is located in the north-west of Hadoti and east of Aravali.

**Page 47**

**Page 49**

## **Hadoti Importance**

**(iii) Population Density:**
*   Population density is high because fertile soil is found here.
**(iii) Minerals:**
* Stone minerals are mainly found in Hadoti, such as sandstone, limestone, red stone (Dholpur stone).
**(iv) Water Productivity / Surface Water:**
*   Water productivity is high in this area because more rivers are found in this physiographic region.
