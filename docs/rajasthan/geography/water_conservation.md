## **A. Water Conservation:**

*   Preventing the wastage of water and limiting the use of usable water is called "water management".

## **I. Traditional Techniques**
### **1. Nadi:** A type of pond in which rainwater is collected.
    * This technique is prevalent in western Rajasthan.
    * The first Nadi was built in Rajasthan in 1590 AD.
### **2. Toba:**
    * Toba is a deeper water storage source than a Nadi, in which rainwater is collected.
     * The water stored in it is used for drinking water and limited irrigation.
### **3. Bawri:**
     *   Bawri are circular and artistic step-like wells.
    *   These water wells depend on rainwater.
    *   The highest number of Bawris are located in Bundi, which is called the "City of Bawris".
*   **Major Bawris:**
        *   1. Nalakha Bawri --> Dungarpur
         *   2. Laheri Bawri --> Sirohi
         *  3. Bhoot Bawri --> Jodhpur (Ransi Village)
        * 4. Alarakali Bawri --> Bundi
        *  5. Chand Bawri --> Abhaneri (Dausa)
         * 6. Badi Bawri/Choti Bawri --> Dausa

*   **Rajasthan ka Bhugol**
     * 7. Dudh Bawri → Sirohi
         * 8. Bhinukhra Bawri -> Udaipur
         * 9. Rani ki Bawri -> Bundi
         * 10. Gulab Bawri -> Bundi
         *  11. Hadi Rani ki Bawri -> Toda Raisingh (Kikri)
         *  12. Nine-Story Bawri -> Nimrana (Kotputli)
###  **4. Jhalra:**
     *  Rectangular pond built for water collection that receives water from a source or pond.
      * Its water is used for religious rituals, not for drinking water.
         *  Ex: Pur Ji Jhalara (Jodhpur)
###  **5. Khadin (Playa):**
    *   Shallow water seals made by Paliwal Brahmins in Western Rajasthan for water harvesting are called Khadin or Playa.
          * These are mostly located in North Jaisalmer.
### **6. Beri (Kui):**
       *  In Western Rajasthan/Arid Border areas (Jaisalmer, Bikaner), small, circular or less deep wells are made for water collection, these are called Beri/Kui.
            *    They depend on ponds and johads for water.
### **7. Tanka/Kund:**
    *   It is mainly constructed for the purpose of drinking water in homes or public places, in which rain water

**Page 285**
*   **Rajasthan ka Bhugol**
       *   (Palar water) is stored.
        *  It is covered from the top for the purity of water.
### 8. **Johad:**
   *   Rainwater flowing towards the slope in the rural area is collected in the low land, which is called Johad.
      *  More prevalent in Shekhawati
      *   It is called "Water Well".
    *  **Note:** The credit for reviving the Johad system goes to Shri Rajendra Singh (Alwar), he is known as "Johad Wale Baba", who was given the 'Ramon Magsaysay Award'.
### **9. Pond:**
  * It is an artificial / natural reservoir whose area extends from one square meter to two hectares.
     *   In which water is available for at least four months in a year.
   *   **Major Ponds:**
        *   Padam Pond
         *   Sareri Pond
        *  Jetala Pond
         *  Khara Pond (Bhilwara)
         *  Kala Pond
        *   Mandalgarh Pond
        *   Sukh Talab (Largest pond of Rajasthan)
       *    **Note:** Bhilwara has the highest irrigation through ponds in Rajasthan.

### 10. **Lake:**
* A water area formed by rainwater and the water of the river banks, which is surrounded by land and water, is called a lake.
    *   Most lakes are in Udaipur
*   **Note:** National Lake Conservation Project: Start: 2001
*  6 Lakes of Rajasthan included:
     1. Fateh Sagar
       *  4. Pushkar
     2. Pichola
       * 5. Nakki
       * 3. Ana Sagar
       *  6. Mansagar
     *  Budget: Center: State (60:40)
## **Modern Methods**
###  **1. Dam/Dam Project:**
   * Dams are used to fulfill various purposes (irrigation, drinking water, hydroelectricity) by stopping the flow of waste water.

### **2. Canal:**
     *  Highest irrigation through canals in Rajasthan is in Sri Ganganagar.

###  **3. Sprinkler and Drip Irrigation Technology**
     *  This technology has been compulsorily implemented in the Narmada canal area in Rajasthan.
       *   This technique has been adopted from Israel.
