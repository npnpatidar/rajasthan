Rajasthan, the largest state in India, experiences a predominantly **desert and semi-arid climate** characterized by extreme temperatures, low rainfall, and significant climatic diversity due to its varied geography. The climate of Rajasthan can be broadly divided into four seasons:

---

### **1. Summer (March to June)**  
- **Temperature:**  
  - **Daytime highs:** 40°C to 45°C (104°F to 113°F), with some areas exceeding 48°C.  
  - **Nighttime lows:** Around 25°C to 30°C.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Scorching heat, especially in the **Thar Desert** and western Rajasthan (Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Bikaner).  
  - **Loo winds** (hot, dry winds) are common during peak summer.  
  - Dust storms occur frequently, reducing visibility and adding to the arid conditions.  
- **Regional Variation:**  
  - Western Rajasthan (desert region) is hotter and drier.  
  - Eastern Rajasthan (Jaipur, Kota) is relatively cooler with some humidity.

### **2. Monsoon (July to September)**  
- **Rainfall:**  
  - Average annual rainfall: 100–400 mm in western Rajasthan and up to 1000 mm in eastern and southeastern Rajasthan (Kota, Udaipur).  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Monsoon winds bring scattered but crucial rainfall.  
  - Rainfall is unevenly distributed, with **Jaisalmer** receiving as little as 100 mm, while **Mount Abu** (a hill station) gets substantial rainfall.  
  - Occasional flash floods in some areas.  
- **Agricultural Impact:**  
  - Rain-fed agriculture benefits from monsoons, though water scarcity remains a challenge in arid zones.

### **3. Post-Monsoon/Autumn (October to November)**  
- **Temperature:**  
  - Daytime: 25°C to 35°C.  
  - Nighttime: 10°C to 20°C.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Transition from humid monsoon to dry and pleasant weather.  
  - Reduced rainfall and clear skies.  
  - Cooler nights, particularly in desert regions.

---

### **4. Winter (December to February)**  
- **Temperature:**  
  - **Daytime highs:** 10°C to 25°C.  
  - **Nighttime lows:** 0°C to 10°C; temperatures in **Mount Abu** can drop below freezing, with occasional frost.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Pleasant weather with cool days and chilly nights.  
  - Desert areas experience significant diurnal temperature variations (warm days, cold nights).  
  - Occasional fog in eastern parts of Rajasthan.

### **Climatic Zones of Rajasthan**  
1. **Arid Region (Western Rajasthan):**  
   - Includes Jaisalmer, Barmer, Bikaner, and parts of Jodhpur.  
   - Extreme temperatures and low rainfall (below 250 mm annually).  
   
2. **Semi-Arid Region (Eastern and Southeastern Rajasthan):**  
   - Includes Jaipur, Udaipur, Kota, and Bundi.  
   - Moderate rainfall (250–1000 mm annually) and less extreme temperatures.  
   
3. **Sub-Humid Region (South Rajasthan):**  
   - Includes **Mount Abu** and parts of Udaipur and Sirohi.  
   - Higher rainfall and cooler temperatures due to altitude.

---

### **Natural Climatic Phenomena**  
- **Thar Desert Effect:**  
  The Thar Desert in western Rajasthan contributes to the arid climate and high temperature extremes.  
- **Dust Storms:**  
  Common in summer, affecting visibility and air quality.  
- **Droughts:**  
  Frequent due to low and erratic rainfall patterns.  
- **Oasis Effect:**  
  Areas like **Jodhpur** and **Udaipur** have water bodies or vegetation, creating localized cooler zones.

---

### **Impact on Lifestyle and Economy**  
- **Agriculture:**  
  Relies heavily on monsoon rains. Crops like bajra, jowar, and mustard dominate.  
- **Water Resources:**  
  Scarcity is a critical issue; Rajasthan depends on rivers like the Chambal and the Indira Gandhi Canal.  
- **Tourism:**  
  Winter is peak tourist season due to favorable weather. Desert safaris and hill stations attract visitors.
