## **1. Meaning of Climate**

*   **Earth**
    *   **Atmosphere**
        *   Long-term events = Climate
        *   Short-term events = Weather

> Long-term events in the atmosphere around the earth are called climate.
> Climate is determined based on the average weather conditions over 30 years.

## **2. What is the climate of Rajasthan like?**
*   A subtropical and arid climate is found in Rajasthan.

## **3. Factors Affecting Climate**
*   (Refer to the Geography of India)

**Page 50**

## **4. Climate Classification**

*   **(i) General Classification** - 5 types
*   **(ii) Individual Classification** - 4 types
    *   Based on Vegetation, Rainfall, Temperature - **According to Köppen** - 4 types
    *   Based on Rainfall - **According to Trewartha** - 4 types
    *   Based on Temperature, Evaporation, Rainfall - **According to Thornthwaite** - 4 types

### **(i) General Classification**
*   According to the general climate classification, the climate of Rajasthan is divided into five parts.
    *   The basis of this classification is temperature and rainfall.

| Type of Climate       | Average Rainfall | Physiographic Region |
| :-------------------- | :--------------- | :------------------ |
| Arid Tropical         | 0-20 cm          | Desert              |

| Humid               | 60-80 cm         | Eastern Plains      |
| Extremely Humid        | 80-120 cm        | Hadoti-Mahi Basin     |

1. Arid Tropical 3. Sub-Humid 5. Extremely Humid
2. Semi-Arid climate 4. Humid climate

**Page 51**

### **(ii) Individual Classification**
**(1) Köppen's Climate Classification**

| D | Frost Equivalent |
| BW | Whole Arid (Dry) |
| BS | Semi-Arid |
| B | Subtropical - precipitation |
| A | Subtropical - Temperature |
| O | A-Hot |

>D and E type of climate is not found in Rajasthan
*   A > Aw > Hot
*   B > BWhw > Arid          w = winter dry
    * BShw > Semi-arid      Average Temperature - h = hot
*   C > Cwg > Subtropical  More than 18°C.  g = gangetic
                                *Gangetic Plain*

## (b) Rainy Season
### Monsoon
*Introduction, Monsoon Name, Monsoon Dates, Monsoon Branches, Monsoon Effect*
1. **Introduction** - Its root word is mausam. It is a word of Arabic language.
*  Unuk = Al Mussi
*  Meaning = Change in season / Change in direction of seasonal winds which move from water to land.
2. **Monsoon Name** -
* The monsoon of India or Rajasthan is called the South-West monsoon which comes from the Indian Ocean.
3. **Monsoon Date** (Only RAS pre)
 
| **Arrival Date**                                      | India     | Rajasthan |

**Page 60**

1.  **Arabian Sea/Himachal Branch:**

    *   This branch reaches Rajasthan but does not cause much rain. It is parallel to the Aravali Range.
        *   The Arabian Sea branch is the main source of humidity in Rajasthan.

2.  **Bay of Bengal/Shivalik Branch:**

    *   This branch helps in causing maximum rainfall.
    *   **Purvai:** The monsoon winds coming from the Bay of Bengal side are called 'Purvai' in Rajasthan.

## **Impact of Monsoon:**

          | Direction of Monsoon | South West  | |
         |           |Maximum Rainfall Direction | From South-West Direction  |
  
             |     |  Maximum Rainfall   |  |
         |-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---|
         | N E |  Decreasing Order of Rainfall   |  |
         |   | Decreasing Order of Rainfall  | |

## **Other Important Points:**

*   **Isohyetal Line:** A line joining places with equal rainfall on a map is called an 'Isohyetal Line.'

    *   25 cm Isohyetal Line
    *   40 cm Isohyetal Line
    *   50 cm Isohyetal Line
       *Arid
       *Semi-Arid

*   **1. 25 cm Isohyetal Line:** This line divides the desert into two parts.
        *   (1) Arid Desert (1 lakh km²)
        *   (2) Semi-Arid Desert (75000 km²)
*  **2. 40 cm Isohyetal Line:** This line divides Rajasthan into two equal parts. This rainfall line is the eastern border of the west desert.
*   **3. 50 cm Isohyetal Line:** (500mm) This Isohyetal line is located on Aravali, which separates the eastern plain and the western desert.

*  **(2) Monsoon Uncertainty:** (Change in dates of monsoon)
  * Uncertainty = 1/year
     * Uncertainty ↑ Rainfall ↓
     * Uncertainty ↓ Rainfall ↑

    *  **Note:**
       * Kal ka ped rengani
       * Or Madhotarm Jhalawar

**Page 62**

*   **(3) Variability in Monsoon:**
        * (Change in the amount of rainfall)
        * Variability ↑  Rainfall ↑
        * Variability ↓ Rainfall ↑

### (c) **Autumn Season**

*   **Monsoon Retreat:** The event of the monsoon returning is called the monsoon retreat.
    *   **Time:** OCT-NOV
*   **Kartik or October Heat:**

    *   The sudden increase in temperature during monsoon retreat is called Kartik Heat.
        *   **Reason:** Decrease in atmospheric humidity and increase in ground humidity.

### (d) **Winter Season**

*   **Mawat:** Rainfall in the winter season, which comes from the Mediterranean Sea due to western disturbances (Jet Stream).

*   **<- Benefited Crop:** Rabi Crop (mainly wheat).
    *   **Note:** Mawat is also called 'Golden Drop' because wheat is a beneficiary of this rainfall.

## **Total Annual Rainfall of Rajasthan**

*   **2 Types:**
   * Monsoonal 90%
   * Mawat 10%

*   **Cold Wave:**
    *   Cold winds coming from the Himalayas in the winter season are called cold waves.
