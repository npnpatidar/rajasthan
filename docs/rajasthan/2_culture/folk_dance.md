These events are also important for sports competitions, entertainment, and providing platforms for tribal communities to showcase their culture, gaining international recognition. Folk songs and dances, in particular, highlight the personification of nature and deep connections to animals and birds, reflecting social beliefs and cultural transmission. They also provided a means of employment for various tribes and played a role in public awakening during the freedom struggle.
