# Basics of Missile Systems

A missile is a *self-propelled, guided weapon system* designed to deliver a payload, typically a warhead, to a specific target. They are essentially intelligent, unmanned rockets equipped with guidance systems that allow them to adjust their flight path in real-time. Missiles can carry conventional warheads, which use high explosives, or non-conventional warheads, including nuclear, chemical, or biological agents.

Missiles are classified based on various factors:

## **Missile Classifications**

- **Trajectory Path**:
    - Ballistic Missiles: Follow a *curved (parabolic) trajectory* after initial propulsion by rocket engines, then free-fall towards the target. They are primarily used for long-range strikes and are harder to detect early due to high-altitude trajectories and faster speeds. Examples include the Agni series and Prithvi.
    - Cruise Missiles: Guided missiles that fly at *low altitudes* and maintain a relatively constant trajectory, propelled by jet engines. They are often smaller and difficult to detect. Examples include BrahMos and Nirbhay.
- **Speed**:
    - Subsonic: Speed less than Mach 1 (e.g., Nirbhay).
    - Supersonic: Speed between Mach 1 and Mach 5 (e.g., BrahMos, Shaurya, Astra).
    - Hypersonic: Speed greater than Mach 5 (e.g., BrahMos-II, Shaurya).
- **Launch Mode**:
    - Surface-to-Surface Missile (SSM).
    - Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM).
    - Air-to-Air Missile (AAM).
    - Air-to-Surface Missile (ASM).
    - Sea-to-Sea, Sea-to-Surface, and Anti-Tank Missiles.
- **Range**:
    - Short-Range Ballistic Missile (SRBM) (<1000 km).
    - Medium-Range Ballistic Missile (MRBM) (1000-3000 km).
    - Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) (3000-5500 km).
    - Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) (>5500 km).

Missiles consist of a warhead, propulsion system, guidance and control system, and other aerodynamic systems like wings.

## **Missile Components**

- **Propulsion Systems**: Provide the thrust.
    - Solid-Fuel Propulsion: Simple, compact, and provide high thrust for rapid acceleration (e.g., Prithvi, BrahMos first stage).
    - Liquid Propulsion: Allows for controlled thrust, used in long-range missiles and space launch vehicles (e.g., Agni series, Akash).
    - Hybrid Propulsion: Combines aspects of solid and liquid systems for controlled thrust (e.g., BrahMos Hypersonic Cruise Missile prototype).
    - Cryogenic Propulsion: Uses liquid oxygen and hydrogen at extremely low temperatures, offering high energy density for heavy-lift missions and long-range ballistic missiles (e.g., Agni-V, GSLV Mk III).
    - Air-Breathing Engines (Ramjet, Scramjet): Fuel-efficient, enabling supersonic and hypersonic flight within the atmosphere (e.g., BrahMos-II).
- **Guidance and Control Systems**: Ensure the missile stays on course and hits the target accurately. Examples include satellite-based guidance (GPS), radar-based guidance (Akash), infrared (IR) guidance (NAG), and laser guidance (LAHAT).

# Indian Missile Programme

India's missile program, primarily managed by the *Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)*, started in the 1960s with the goal of achieving self-sufficiency in defense technology.

## Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP)

# Indian Missile Defence Systems

India has developed a *multi-layered Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) system* to protect against ballistic missile attacks, comprising two main tiers:

## **Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) System**

1.  **Exo-atmospheric Layer**: Intercepts missiles at altitudes of 50-150 km, developed with the *Prithvi Air Defence (PAD)* interceptor missile (also called Pradyumna).
2.  **Endo-atmospheric Layer**: Intercepts missiles at altitudes below 40 km, developed with the *Advanced Air Defence (AAD)* interceptor missile (also called Ashwin). This system is complemented by *Swordfish LRTR* (Long Range Tracking Radar) for target acquisition and fire control. India became the *fifth nation globally* to have a robust Ballistic Missile Defence system.

## **Other Air Defense Systems**

- **S-400 Triumf**: A highly advanced long-range surface-to-air missile system procured from Russia, capable of engaging aircraft, UAVs, and ballistic missiles up to 400 km.

# International Context

India's entry into the *Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR)* in 2016 as the 35th member has enhanced its non-proliferation image and enabled the procurement of advanced missile technology and collaboration on UAV development projects with other nations. This membership entails obligations such as sharing critical military and technological information and consulting on MTCR-related exports.
