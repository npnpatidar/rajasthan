# Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)

RFID is a _wireless technology_ that uses _radio waves_ to identify and track objects, people, or animals. Unlike barcodes and QR codes, RFID does not require direct contact or a clear line of sight for data exchange, making it a _more advanced system_. It allows for simultaneous, non-contact, and multi-object identification over varying distances.

## Key Characteristics of RFID

* _Contactless data transmission_.
* _Fast and automatic scanning_.
* _Tracking and monitoring_ of objects and animals.
* _Data storage and security_.
* _High data integrity_.
* _Efficiency_.
* _Enhanced security_.

## Components of an RFID System

An RFID system primarily consists of three main components:

1. RFID Tag (Transponder)
   - A small device attached to the object being tracked.
   - **Structure**: Composed of a _microchip_ that stores unique identification data and an _antenna_ that enables communication by receiving and transmitting radio signals. An encapsulation layer, typically made of plastic, glass, or ceramic, protects the chip and antenna.
   - **Types of Tags**:
     - **Passive Tags**: These tags _do not have an internal power source_. They are powered by the electromagnetic energy transmitted from the RFID reader. They are cost-effective but have a shorter read range, typically up to 10 meters. Applications include retail and library book tracking.
     - **Active Tags**: These tags _contain an internal battery_ for continuous signal transmission. They offer a longer range, up to 100 meters, but are more expensive. They are used in toll collection (e.g., FASTag) and vehicle tracking.
     - **Semi-passive RFID**: These tags have a battery but use it only when activated by a reader, relying on the reader's energy for data transmission. They offer a longer range than passive tags but are not as powerful as active tags, used for applications like medical equipment tracking.
     - **Smart Labels**: A combination of a barcode and RFID, offering benefits of both technologies.
     - **Embedded RFID Tags**: Placed inside an item, making them invisible, often used for identifying counterfeit products and security.
     - **Disposable RFID Tags**: Designed for single use, such as for ticketing, medical tracking, and food packaging.
     - **Read-Only Tags**: Data cannot be altered after programming.
     - **Read/Write Tags**: Can be reprogrammed with new data.
     - **Write-Once, Read-Many (WORM) Tags**: Data can be written once and read multiple times, ensuring data integrity.

2. RFID Reader (Interrogator)
   - A device that _emits radio signals_ and _receives data_ from RFID tags.
   - It generates an electromagnetic field to power passive tags or assist active tags in communication.
   - After receiving the signal, the reader decodes the data and sends it to a computer system for processing.
   - **Types of Readers**:
     - **Fixed readers**: Installed at specific locations like entrances or warehouses.
     - **Mobile readers**: Handheld devices for flexible tag reading.

3. Backend System / Middleware or Software
   - This is a database or server that _processes and analyzes_ the data received from the RFID reader. It can be stored in the cloud, on a network, or a local server.
   - Middleware acts as an intermediary, processing data from the reader and providing real-time updates for various management tasks.

## Working Principle of RFID

The RFID system operates through the following steps:

1.  Signal Emission
    The RFID reader emits a radio frequency signal.
2.  Tag Activation/Response
    - If the tag is _passive_, it draws energy from the reader's signal to power its microchip and transmit its stored data.
    - If the tag is _active_, it uses its internal power source to send data.
3.  Data Reception
    The reader receives the data transmitted by the tag. This data can include unique identification numbers, location, or stock details.
4.  Data Processing
    The received data is then forwarded to a backend system or cloud server for further analysis and use in various applications like inventory tracking or security monitoring.

## Types of RFID Systems Based on Frequency

RFID systems operate across various frequency bands, each suited for different applications:
