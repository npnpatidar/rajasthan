# Robotics

Robotics is a *branch of engineering science and technology* that deals with the *design, construction, operation, manufacture, and application of robots*. It combines disciplines such as mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and artificial intelligence (AI). The goal of robotics is to create machines that can assist and substitute for humans in various tasks. The term "Robotics" was first used by Isaac Asimov.

A robot is defined as an *automated, reprogrammable, multifunctional manipulator* designed to perform a variety of tasks through programmed motion, similar to a human. It is a self-propelled, automated machine that can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. Robots can resemble humans (humanoids) or be functional and task-specific (industrial robots or drones).

## Components of Robots

A robot needs several components to be functional and efficient, integrating mechanical, electronic, computer science, and artificial intelligence elements:

- **Structural System (Structure or Body)**: This is the physical frame or body of the robot, often made from metal, plastic, or carbon fiber. Its design varies based on the robot's function (e.g., humanoid, industrial robot, drone).
- **Actuators**: These are the mechanisms that provide motion to the robot's body. They convert energy into movement. Key types include:
  - **Electric Motors** (DC/Stepper/Servo Motors).
  - **Hydraulic Actuators** (for heavy lifting robots).
  - **Piezolelectric Actuators** (for precise movements).
  - **Linear Actuators** (for pushing or pulling).
- **Sensors**: These devices provide data about the robot's environment. Types include:
  - **Vision Sensors** (e.g., cameras, LIDAR) for object detection.
  - **Tactile Sensors** (for robotic hands).
  - **Motion and Position Sensors** (e.g., Gyroscope, Accelerometer, IMU).
  - **Environmental Sensors** (e.g., Temperature, Humidity, Pressure Sensors).
  - **Proximity sensors** (to detect nearby obstacles).
- **Control System (Controller)**: This system directs the robot's activities and acts as its "brain." It processes sensory information and computes control commands for actuators. Microcontrollers (Arduino, PIC, AVR), microprocessors (Raspberry Pi, ARM Processors), and Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) are common. The control system executes a program (software code).
- **Robotic Mind (Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning)**: AI and ML make robots smart, enabling them to learn from data and make decisions based on experience. This involves deep learning, neural networks, computer vision, and natural language processing (NLP).
- **Power Source (Power Supply)**: Various sources provide energy for the robot, such as Lithium-ion batteries (for mobile robots), solar power (for sustainable robotics), and hydraulic/pneumatic energy (for industrial robots).
- **Communication System**: This enables data transmission between the robot and other systems (computers, other robots, humans). Technologies include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, CAN, I2C, SPI, UART, 5G, and IoT.
- **Robotic Software & Programming**: Software is essential for the robot's operation and control. Programming languages like Python, C++, MATLAB, and Robot Operating System (ROS) are used, along with simulation and design software (e.g., Gazebo, V-REP, Webots).
- **End Effector**: This refers to the robot's "hand" or the part that performs specific tasks, such as grippers for holding objects, welding torches, or 3D printing nozzles.
- **Robotic Navigation System**: For autonomous robots, techniques like SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) are used, incorporating GPS, IMU, LIDAR, and computer vision.
- **Manipulator**: The physical part for movement and interaction, like robotic arms or grippers.
