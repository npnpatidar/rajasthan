# Analog and Digital Communication

Telecommunication is the process of transmitting information, such as voice, data, and video, from one location to another. This can be achieved through either analog or digital communication systems.

## Analogue Telecommunication

Analogue telecommunication is a communication system where *information is transmitted as continuous signals*. These signals continuously vary in amplitude, frequency, or phase. Traditional radio, telephone, and television broadcasting systems commonly used this method.

**Characteristics of Analog Communication**:

*   **Continuity**: Analog signals change continuously over time and are not limited to specific fixed values. They mirror the original information.
*   **Noise Sensitivity**: Analog signals are more vulnerable to external interference (noise), which can degrade their quality. This degradation is more pronounced over long distances. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is crucial for quality, with a higher SNR indicating a clearer signal.
*   **Bandwidth**: They often require a wider bandwidth for higher quality signals. For example, the bandwidth for human speech is about 4 kHz, while AM radio transmission uses about 10 kHz, and FM transmission uses 15 kHz.
*   **Natural Signal Processing**: Analog systems can easily process natural signals like voice, video, and audio.

**Components of Analog Communication Systems**:

*   **Source**: The device that originates the information, such as a microphone or camera.
*   **Modulator**: This process prepares the information signal for transmission by combining it with a high-frequency carrier signal.
*   **Transmitter**: Sends the modulated signal through the channel. It can also amplify the signal.
*   **Channel**: The medium through which the signal travels to the receiver, such as wires, radio waves, or optical fiber.
*   **Receiver**: Collects the transmitted signal and converts it into useful information.
*   **Demodulator**: Recovers the original information from the modulated signal.

**Analog Modulation Techniques**: Modulation is the process of altering a carrier wave's characteristics in accordance with the information signal.

*   **Amplitude Modulation (AM)**: The amplitude of the carrier signal changes according to the information signal. This technique is used in AM radio broadcasting but is sensitive to noise.
*   **Frequency Modulation (FM)**: The frequency of the carrier signal varies with the information signal. FM radio broadcasting uses this for higher quality audio.
*   **Phase Modulation (PM)**: The phase of the carrier signal is changed based on the message signal. This is also used in digital communication.

**Examples of Analog Communication**:

*   **AM Radio**: Radio broadcasting using amplitude modulation.
*   **FM Radio**: Used for high-quality audio broadcasting.
*   **Traditional Television Broadcasting**: Analog signals were used for video and audio transmission.
*   **Telephone Networks**: Older landline telephones communicated via analog signals.

**Advantages of Analog Communication**:

*   **Simplicity**: Often simpler and cheaper to implement and maintain.
*   **Natural Representation**: Captures and transmits natural signals like voice easily.
*   **Continuous Transmission**: Suitable for real-time transmission, such as voice communication.

**Disadvantages of Analog Communication**:

*   **Lower Capacity and Efficiency**: Less efficient in bandwidth usage.
*   **Susceptibility to Noise**: More prone to degradation by noise and interference.
*   **Less Secure**: Generally less secure compared to digital signals.

## Digital Telecommunication

Digital telecommunication is a communication system where *information is converted into discrete signals, represented by binary digits (0s and 1s), and transmitted*. This forms the foundation of modern communication technologies like the Internet and mobile communication.

**Characteristics of Digital Communication**:

*   **Binary Representation**: Information is transmitted in binary format (0s and 1s).
*   **Reduced Noise and Interference**: Digital signals have a lower probability of noise compared to analog signals. Errors can often be detected and corrected.
*   **Faster Transmission**: Digital communication can transmit data at higher speeds.
*   **Data Compression**: Data can be compressed, saving space and bandwidth.
*   **Enhanced Security**: Data can be encrypted, making communication more secure.
*   **Error Correction**: Digital communication systems utilize techniques for error detection and correction.
*   **Discrete Values**: Represents precise, discontinuous values.

**Components of Digital Communication Systems**:

*   **Source**: Device generating information, such as a computer or mobile phone.
*   **Encoder**: Converts information into a digital format (0s and 1s).
*   **Modulator**: Combines the digital signal with a high-frequency carrier signal for transmission.
*   **Transmitter**: Sends the modulated signal through the communication channel.
*   **Channel**: The medium for digital signal travel, which can be wired (e.g., optical fiber, Ethernet) or wireless (e.g., radio waves, satellites).
*   **Receiver**: Captures the signal and demodulates it.
*   **Decoder**: Converts the digital signal back into its original information.
*   **Destination**: The final endpoint where the information is used.

**Digital Modulation Techniques**:

*   **Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)**: The amplitude of the carrier signal varies based on the digital data.
*   **Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)**: The frequency of the carrier signal changes according to the digital data.
*   **Phase Shift Keying (PSK)**: The phase of the carrier signal is altered based on the digital data.
*   **Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)**: Combines ASK and PSK to achieve higher data rates.
*   **Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)**: A preferred scheme for pulsed carrier waves where the analog signal is sampled and quantized into a binary code for transmission.

**Examples of Digital Communication**:

*   **Mobile Communication**: 4G and 5G networks are based on digital communication technologies.
*   **Internet**: All internet services, including email, video calls, and web browsing, use digital communication.
*   **Satellite Communication**: Transmits television and data via satellites using digital techniques.
