## Basic Knowledge of Double Entry System

**DEFINITION** – A system of recording financial transactions where every transaction affects at least two accounts ensuring that the accounting equation (**Assets= Liability + Equity**) remains balanced.

**ACCOUNTING** – Business transactions keeps on going continuously in every business. Due to inherent limitation of human mind it is impossible to remember every transaction therefore these transactions are recorded in writing. The art of recording these transactions is known as accounting.

## Accounting System Classification

**ACCOUNTING SYSTEM CAN BE CLASSIFIED IN TWO MAJOR CATEGORIES**

1.  **SINGLE ENTRY SYSTEM** – According to this system business transactions affects only one account therefore all business transactions are recorded at one place only, in accounting books.

    E.g. **Government Accounting**
2.  **DOUBLE ENTRY SYSTEM** – According to this system every business transaction affects at least two accounts therefore every transaction is recorded at two places in the accounting book.

    E.g. **Salary paid** – **Cash Account**
    **Salary Account**



## Types of Accounts in Accounting

**THERE ARE 3 TYPES OF ACCOUNTS IN ACCOUNTING:**

1.  **PERSONAL ACCOUNT** – This category covers accounts related to human beings or institutions.

    E.g. Ram's Acc., Shyam's Acc.

## Rules of Accounting

**RULES OF ACCOUNTING – ALSO C/D GOLDEN RULES OF ACCOUNTING**

|       | **DEBIT**   | **CREDIT**   |
| :- | :- | :-- |
| **PERSONAL** | **RECIEVER**  | **GIVER**      |
| **REAL**   | **WHAT COMES IN** | **WHAT GOES OUT** |
| **NOMINAL** | **EXPENSE/LOSS** | **INCOME/PROFIT** |

**Condition that needs to be fulfilled for a transaction to be added in accounting:**

1.  Must be related to business.
2.  Must have monetary value.



## Analysis of Financial Statements

**FINANCIAL STATEMENT** – They are a set of documents that show company's financial status at a specific point of time.

*   They include key data on what your company owns & owes and how much money it has made and spent.
*   These statements are prepared in final step of accounting.
*   They are also known as gist of accounting.
*   Also known as final account because accounting process completes after preparation of these statements.
*   Every business wants to know the result of business i.e. profit or loss & its financial position, therefore financial statements are prepared.



## Main Financial Statements

**FOUR MAIN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:**

*   Balance Sheet
*   Income statement
*   Cash flow statement
*   Statement of retained earnings

**BALANCE SHEET** – It is statement of financial position of business.

*   It shows what a company owns & owes at end of a period.
*   It this statement assets are recorded in one, side & liabilities on other & the total of both sides remains equal.
*   It is prepared on particular point of time.



##  Why is Analysis of Financial Statements Done?

4.  **WHY IS ANALISIS OF FINALCIAL STATEMENTS DONE?**

    *   Financial statements provided info about P&L or asset-liabilities of the business but fails to provide info about productivity or performance in comparison with others.
    *   Therefore, Analysis of financial statement is required.

**TYPES OF FINANCIAL STATEMENT ANALYSIS**

| **On the basis of information used** | **On the basis of functionality or nature** |
| :- | :-- |
| **INTERNAL**                          | **VERTICAL**                            |
| **EXTERNAL**                          | **HORIZONTAL**                          |



*   **INTERNAL ANALYSIS** –

    When information used for analysis is available only to internal people of the company (E.g. Manager, Owner etc) then such analysis is c/d internal analysis.

*   **EXTERNAL ANALYSIS** –

    Analysis by outsiders on the basis of published information such as tax department, banks etc.



*   **VERTICAL ANALYSIS**

    Analysis of data of one year for one company.
*   **HORIZONTAL ANALYSIS** –

    Analysis of data of more than one company or more than one year.



## Techniques of Financial Statement Analysis

**TECHNIQUES OF FINANCIAL STATEMENT ANALYSIS**

1.  Break even point
2.  Ratio Analysis
3.  Cash flow Analysis
4.  Fund flow Analysis
5.  Common size fin. Statement
6.  Trend analysis
7.  Comparative financial statement



### Break Even Point

1.  **BREAK EVEN POINT**

Break even point is a level of sale or products where all costs are met by sales price meaning no P&L at this point. Every unit sold beyond this point is profitable and sales below this level is loss making

*   Cost can be divided into two parts.

(A) **FIX COST** -

*   Means cost having no direct relation with quantum of sales of production.
*   Meaning it remains constant irrespective of level of sales.

    E.g. Factory Rent

(B) **VARIABLE COST** – Cost which keeps on changing with change in quantity of goods produced or sold E.g. – Raw Material

```
BEP = FIX COST / (SALE PRICE PERCENT – VARIABLE CHANGE)
```



### Ratio Analysis

2.  **RATIO ANALYSIS** -

It is used to establish mathematical relationship b/w two numbers.

**TYPES**

| **On the basis of information used** | **On the basis of functionality** |
| :- | :-- |
| i. **Profit** & **loss accounts ratio** | i. **Profitability ratio**   |
| ii. **Balance sheet ratio**    | ii. **Liquidity ratio**   |
| iii. **Inter statement ratio**  | iii. **Capital structure ratio**   |
|                                     | iv. **Activity ratio/Turnover ratio**  |
|                                     | v. **Market test ratio**  |



#### Profitability Ratio

*   **PROFITABILITY RATIO** – These ratio indicates profit earning capacity of the business.

These can be of two types

a) Profitability ratio based on sale

$$
GROSS\_PROFIT\_RATIO = \left( \frac{GROSS\_PROFIT}{NET\_SALES} \right) \times 100
$$

$$
NET\_PROFIT\_RATIO = \left( \frac{NET\_PROFIT}{NET\_SALES} \right) \times 100
$$

$$
OPERATING\_PROFIT\_RATIO = \left( \frac{OPERATING\_PROFIT}{NET\_SALES} \right) \times 100
$$

$$
OPERATING\_EXPENSES\_RATIO = \left( \frac{OPERATING\_EXPENSES}{NET\_SALES} \right) \times 100
$$

$$
ADMIN\_EXPENSES\_RATIO = \left( \frac{ADMIN\_EXPENSES}{NET\_SALES} \right) \times 100
$$




b) PROFITABILITY RATIO BASED ON CAPITAL/ INVESTMENT


$$
RETURN\_ON\_INVESTMENT = \left( \frac{PBIT}{CAPITAL\_EMPLOYED} \right) \times 100
$$

$$
RETURN\_ON\_OWNERS\_CAPITAL = \left( \frac{PAT}{OWNERS\_CAPITAL} \right) \times 100
$$

$$
RETURN\_ON\_EQUITY\_SHAREHOLDERS\_FUND = \left( \frac{PAT - PREFERENCE\_DIVIDEND}{EQUITY\_SHAREHOLDERS\_FUND} \right) \times 100
$$




#### Liquidity Ratio

*   **LIQUIDITY RATIO** – Used to examine short term payment capacity or short term solvency of the business.

**TYPE** -

a) **CURRENT RATIO** – It indicates repayment capacity of liabilities arising within one year its ideal ratio 2:1


$$
CURRENT\_RATIO = \frac{CURRENT\_ASSET}{CURRENT\_LIABILITY}
$$


b) **QUICK RATIO/ACID TEST** – If liabilities arise within very short period then capacity of their repayment can be examined by this ratio Ideal ratio = 1:1


$$
QUICK\_RATIO = \frac{QUICK\_ASSET}{CURRENT\_LIABILITY}
$$

$$
QUICK\_ASSETS = CURRENT\_ASSETS - PREPAID\_EXPENSES - STOCK
$$




#### Activity Ratio

c) **ACTIVITY RATIO** – Calculated to examine efficiency of management

In these ratio assets etc. are compared with turnover


$$
FIXED\_ASSETS\_TURNOVER\_RATIO = \frac{TURNOVER}{AVG.\ FIX\ ASSETS}
$$

$$
CURRENT\_ASSETS\_TURNOVER\_RATIO = \frac{TURNOVER}{CURRENT\_ASSET}
$$

$$
DEBTORS\_TURNOVER\_RATIO = \frac{CREDIT\_SALE}{AVG.\ DEBTORS}
$$

$$
CREDIT\_TURNOVER\_RATIO = \frac{CREDIT\_PURCHASE}{AVG.\ CREDITORS}
$$

$$
STOCK\_TURNOVER\_RATIO = \frac{COST\ OF\ GOODS\ SOLD}{AVG.\ STOCK}
$$




#### Capital Structure Ratio

d) **Capital structure ratio**


$$
DEBT\_EQUITY\_RATIO = \frac{DEBT}{EQUITY}
$$

$$
PROPRIETARY\_RATIO = \frac{FIXED\_ASSET}{EQUITY\_SHARE\_CAP}
$$

$$
INTEREST\_SERVICE\_COVERAGE\_RATIO = \frac{PBIT}{INTEREST}
$$

$$
DEBT\_SERVICE\_COVERAGE\_RATIO = \frac{PBIT}{INTEREST + EMI}
$$


#### Market Test Ratio

e) Market Test Ratio

$$
EPS\_RATIO = \frac{PAT - PREFERENCE\_DIVIDEND}{NO.\ OF\ EQUITY\_SHARE}
$$

$$
DPS = \frac{EQUITY\_DIVIDEND}{NO.\ OF\ EQUITY\_SHARE}
$$

$$
P/E\_RATIO = \left( \frac{EPS}{MARKET\_PRICE\_EARNING} \right) \times 100
$$




### Trend Analysis

| :- | :-- | :- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| PURCHASE | 3L     | 50%| SALE   | 6L     | 100%|
| WAGES    | 3L     | 50%|        |        |     |
|          | 6L     |100%|        |        |     |
|          |        |    | 6L     |        |     |
