## Accounting & Auditing (20 Marks)

**Exam Approach:**  Unlike CA or CS exams, RAS Mains focuses on conceptual understanding and basic calculations, not detailed preparation.

**Syllabus Coverage:**

1.  **Basic Knowledge of Double-Entry System:**
    *   **Definition:** A system recording financial transactions affecting at least two accounts, ensuring the accounting equation remains balanced (Assets = Liabilities + Equity).  For exam, write: "A system of recording financial transactions where every transaction affects at least two accounts, ensuring the accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) remains balanced."
    *   **Accounting Equation:** Assets = Liabilities + Equity
    *   **Purpose of Accounting:**  To record business transactions due to human memory limitations.  For exam, write: "Due to the inherent limitations of the human mind, it is impossible to remember every business transaction; therefore, these transactions are recorded in writing. The art of recording these transactions is known as accounting."
    *   **Steps in Accounting (RCS):** Recording, Classifying, Presenting.
    *   **Accounting Books:** Journal (original entry), Subsidiary Books (cash book, sales book etc.), Ledger (principal entry), Trial Balance.
    *   **Objectives of Accounting:** Calculate profit/loss, determine financial position, provide future evidence, facilitate better financial management.
    *   **Single-Entry System:** Records transactions in one place only; lacks balancing.  Used by some governments.
    *   **Double-Entry System:** Records each transaction in two places; balances the accounting equation.
    *   **Three Types of Accounts:** Personal (individuals, organizations), Real (assets, goods), Nominal (income, expenses, profit/loss).  For exam, simply list: Personal, Real, Nominal.
    *   **Golden Rules of Accounting (Memorize):**  (See table below)
    *   **Conditions for adding transactions:** Must be business-related and have monetary value.

| Account Type    | Debit                               | Credit                              |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Personal        | Receiver                            | Giver                               |
| Real            | What comes in (increases assets)   | What goes out (decreases assets)     |
| Nominal         | Expenses and Losses                 | Income and Gains                     |


2.  **Techniques of Financial Statement Analysis:**

    *   **Financial Statements:** Documents showing a company's financial status at a specific point. Include data on assets, liabilities, income, expenses.  Considered the "gist" of accounting.
    *   **Types of Financial Statement Analysis:**
        *   **Based on Information:** Internal (for internal use) and External (for outsiders like banks and tax authorities).
        *   **Based on Functionality:** Vertical (one year's data) and Horizontal (multiple years' or companies' data).
    *   **Techniques:**
        *   **Break-Even Point:** Sales/production level where total costs equal total revenue (no profit or loss). Formula: Fixed Costs / (Selling Price per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit)
        *   **Ratio Analysis:** Establishes mathematical relationships between two numbers.  (See formulas below)
        *   **Cash Flow Analysis:** Analyzes cash inflows and outflows from operations, investments, and financing.
        *   **Fund Flow Analysis:**  Analyzes changes in assets and liabilities between two balance sheet dates, including both cash and non-cash transactions.
        *   **Common Size Financial Statement:** Presents financial data as percentages of a base figure (e.g., sales).
        *   **Trend Analysis:** Analyzes data over multiple years to identify increasing or decreasing trends.
        *   **Comparative Financial Statement:** Compares data from multiple companies or years.

**Ratio Analysis Formulas (Memorize key ones based on past papers):**

*   **Gross Profit Ratio:** (Gross Profit / Net Sales) x 100
*   **Net Profit Ratio:** (Net Profit / Net Sales) x 100
*   **Operating Profit Ratio:** (Operating Profit / Net Sales) x 100
*   **Return on Investment (ROI):** (Profit Before Interest & Tax (PBIT) / Capital Employed) x 100
*   **Return on Owners' Capital:** (Profit After Tax (PAT) / Owners' Capital) x 100
*   **Return on Equity:** ((PAT - Preference Dividend) / Equity Shareholders' Funds) x 100
*   **Current Ratio:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities (Ideal: 2:1)
*   **Quick Ratio (Acid Test):** (Quick Assets / Current Liabilities) (Ideal: 1:1)  Quick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory - Prepaid Expenses
*   **Debt-Equity Ratio:** Debt / Equity
*   **Proprietary Ratio:** Fixed Assets / Equity Share Capital
*   **Interest Coverage Ratio:** PBIT / Interest
*   **Debt Service Coverage Ratio:** PBIT / (Interest + EMI)
*   **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** (PAT - Preference Dividend) / Number of Equity Shares
*   **Dividend Per Share (DPS):** Equity Dividend / Number of Equity Shares
*   **Price-Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio):** (Market Price per Share / EPS) x 100


3.  **Responsibility Accounting:** Divides business activities into responsibility centers with assigned targets and individual accountability.  Objectives: Improves accountability, facilitates performance evaluation, aids decision-making, enhances organizational control. Limitations: Potential conflicts between goals, difficulty in accurate cost allocation, focus on short-term results.

4.  **Social Accounting/Auditing:** Analyzes social costs of business against social welfare activities.  Objectives: Enhances transparency, fosters accountability for social and environmental impacts, promotes sustainable development, improves reputation. Limitations: Difficulty in identifying and quantifying social impacts, lack of accepted framework, high cost, potential for selective reporting.

5.  **Auditing:** Independent examination of financial statements and other accounting records, expressing an opinion on their fairness and accuracy.  Types: Final Audit, Interim Audit, Concurrent Audit; External (Statutory, mandated by law, often by independent firms); Internal (performed by company employees, voluntary). Objectives: Independent and unbiased examination, identifying errors and fraud, ensuring legal compliance, improving future performance, building trust. Limitations: Some errors may be unchecked (sampling), potential for human error, auditor integrity may be influenced, documents may be incomplete or manipulated. Audit Reports: Clean, Adverse, Disclaimer, Qualified.

6.  **Government Auditing:**  Includes internal and external audits.  CAg performs performance audits to ensure efficient use of taxpayer money.  Performance Audit may be regulatory or performance-based.  Reports to Parliament and Public Accounts Committee (PAC).

7.  **Performance Auditing (ECPA/VFM):** Comprehensive review of projects/programs to assess goal achievement and resource utilization.  Objectives: Assess the effectiveness of resource utilization and identify areas for improvement. Limitations: Difficulty quantifying qualitative aspects and challenges in comparing performance across different contexts.

8.  **Efficiency Audit:** Examines the efficiency of a department in utilizing allocated resources. Conducted by CAG.

9.  **Performance Budgeting:** Combines outcome budgets of different ministries.  Compares allocated resources with expected physical outputs.

10. **Zero-Based Budgeting:** Starts budgeting from a "zero base," disregarding previous year's budget.  Requires justification for all funding requests. Aims to improve fiscal discipline.


**Important Note:** Focus your revision on the most frequently tested concepts and formulas. Prioritize understanding core concepts over memorizing every detail. Use past papers to identify high-yield areas.
