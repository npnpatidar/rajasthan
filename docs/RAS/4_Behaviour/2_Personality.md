### Trait Approach

*   **Goal:** Discover building blocks of personality - specific psychological attributes.
*   Focuses on differences *between* individuals.
*   These traits should be relatively stable over time.

#### Characteristics

*   **Stability:** Relatively stable over time.
*   **Consistency:** Consistent across situations.
*   **Strength Variation:** Strength and combination of traits vary across individuals.
*   **Individual Differences:** Leads to individual differences in personality.

#### 1. Allport's Trait Theory

*   Categorizes traits into three groups:

| **Trait Type**       | **Definition**                                                      | **Characteristics**                                           | **Example**                        |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Cardinal Traits**  | Dominating traits that define a person's life goal             | Highly generalized, Pervasive, Associated with a person's name | Gandhi’s Non-Violence           |
| **Central Traits**   | General traits that form the core personality                 | Less pervasive, Used in testimonials or job recommendations | Honesty, Altruism               |
| **Secondary Traits** | Traits that appear only in specific situations                | Least generative, Context-dependent                     | Liking ethnic clothes, Nervousness before public speaking |

#### 2. Raymond Cattell's Classification

*   16 Primary Factor Questionnaire (16PFQ)
*   Divides personality factors into:

| **Characteristic**      | **Source Traits**                          | **Surface Traits**                          |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | Core traits that are stable and fundamental | Observable traits influenced by Source Traits |
| **Nature**            | More stable, Deep-rooted       | More changeable, Visible in behavior |
| **Function**          | Act as building blocks of personality | Result from interaction of Source Traits |
| **Example**           | Emotional Stability           | Honesty, Sociability |

#### 3. Eysenck's Trait Theory

*   Based on biological/genetic factors.
*   Two broad dimensions (later expanded to three):
    *   **Extroversion vs. Introversion:** Degree to which people are socially outgoing or withdrawn
        *   Extroverts: Gregarious, Active, Impulsive.
        *   Introverts: Passive, Quiet, Cautious.
    *   **Neuroticism vs. Emotional Stability:** Degree to which people have control over their feelings
        *   Neurotic: Anxious, Moody, Over-sensitive, Lacks Control.
        *   Emotionally Stable: Calm, Composed, Reliable, Self-controlled.
    *   **Psychoticism vs. Socialization:** Interact with other two dimensions
        *   Psychoticism (High): Hostile, Egocentric, Anti-social.
        *   Socialization (High): Cooperative, Altruistic, Empathetic.

#### 4. Five-Factor Model (Big Five)

*   Developed by Paul Costa and Robert McCrae.
*   Five broad dimensions: (**OCEAN**)

| **Trait**                  | **High Score Characteristics**                                  | **Low Score Characteristics** |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Openness to Experience** | Imaginative, Curious, Interested in culture                     | Rigid, Practical              |
| **Conscientiousness**      | Achievement-oriented, Dependable, Hard-working, Self-controlled | Impulsive                     |
| **Extraversion**           | Sociable, Assertive, Outgoing, Fun-loving                       | Shy                           |
| **Agreeableness**          | Helpful, Cooperative, Friendly, Caring                          | Hostile, Self-centered        |
| **Neuroticism**            | Emotionally unstable, Anxious, Worried, Irritable               | Well-adjusted, Stable         |

*   **Conclusion:**
    *   The Five-Factor Model is useful in understanding personality profiles across cultures and is considered a promising empirical approach to the study of personality.

## Assessment of Personality

*   **Definition:** Formal effort to understand personality, predict behavior with minimum error and maximum accuracy.
*   Three Basic Divisions:
    *   Self-Report Measures
    *   Projective Techniques
    *   Behavioral Analysis

### Comparison: Self-Report vs. Projective Techniques

| Feature      | Self-Report Measures    | Projective Techniques |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| Nature       | Direct Personality Test | Indirect Test         |
| Reliability  | Less Reliable           | More Reliable         |
| Subjectivity | Subjective              | Objective             |

### Self-Report Measures

*   Involve direct questions answered by the individual.
*   Examples:
    *   MMPI (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory)
    *   16PFQ (Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire)
    *   Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ)

#### 1. MMPI (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory)

*   Developed by **Hathaway and McKinley** (1943).
*   Tool for psychiatric diagnosis.
*   **567** **questions** (True/False), divided into 10 sub-scales.
*   Used in diagnosing psychological abnormalities (e.g., Depression, Social Introversion).
*   Indian adaptation: **Jodhpur Multiphasic Personality Inventory (JMPI) by Malik and Joshi** .

#### 2. 16PFQ (Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire)

*   Developed by **Raymond Cattell**.
*   **164 statements.**
*   Useful for **career guidance** and vocational exploration for students and adults.

#### 3. Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ)

*   Developed by **Hans Eysenck and Sybil Eysenck** (1975).
*   Based on **32 traits.**
*  **57 questions**.
*  Assess the two dimensions of personality
*   Revised version (EPQR) with full (100 questions) and short (48 questions) versions in 1985.

#### Problems with Self-Report Measures

*   Can be unreliable; answers may be influenced by social desirability.

### Projective Techniques

*   Access unconscious motives and feelings.
*   Examples:
    *   Rorschach Inkblot Test
    *   Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)
    *   Sentence Completion Test
    *   Rosenzweig Picture-Frustration Study
    *   Draw-a-Person Test

#### 1. Rorschach Inkblot Test

*   **10 inkblot cards (5 Black & White, 2 Red, 3 Colourful)**.
*   Subject responds to the images on the cards.
*   Two phases:
    *   *Performance Proper*: What the subject sees in each card.
    *   *Inquiry*: Where, how, and why the subject gave a particular response.

#### 2. Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)

*   Developed by **Christiana Morgan and Henry Murray** (1930s).
*   **31 cards (30 picture cards, 1 blank).**
*   Subject creates a **short story** based on each picture.
*   Assesses personality based on the story content.
*   *Apperception:* How new experiences are assimilated and transformed by residues of past experiences.
*   Analysis focuses on:
    *  Hero (protagonist) 
    *  Needs(28 needs of the hero).
    *  Press (30 environmental forces).
    *  Thema (interaction between hero and press).
    *  Outcome (of the story).
*   Indian version developed by **Uma Chaudhari**.

#### 3. Sentence Completion Test

*   Incomplete sentences are presented; subject completes them.
*   Completed sentences are used to assess personality.
*   Considered a semi-projective method.

#### 4. Rosenzweig Picture-Frustration Study

*   **24 cartoon pictures** depicting a frustrating situation.
*   Subject describes the response of the frustrated person.
*   Provides information about how people express aggression in frustrating situations.
*   Indian version developed by **Uday Pareek**.

#### 5. Draw-a-Person Test

*   Subject draws a person and write story about it.
*   Certain characteristics of the drawing (e.g., large hands, big head) are interpreted as indicators of specific personality traits.

### Behavioral Analysis Techniques

*   Analyzes a person's behavior in different situations.
*   Examples:
    *   Interview
    *   Observation
    *   Situation Test (SRT - Situation Reaction Test)
    *   Nomination

#### 1. Interview

* Structured (fixed questions) - to develop an impression potential to reveal subject's personality
* Unstructured (open-ended questions) - to make objective comparison of subject's personality

#### 2. Observation

*   A trained observer notes the individual's behavior, gestures, posture, body language.

#### 3. Situation Test (Situation Reaction Test - SRT)

*   The person is placed in a specific situation, and their behavior is studied.

#### 4. Nomination

*   Peer assessment: People who know the individual well are asked to describe their personality or choose them for specific tasks.

## Nomothetic vs. Idiographic Approaches

| Feature       | Nomothetic Approach                  | Idiographic Approach            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Meaning       | "Custom" or "Law"                     | "One's Own," "Private"           |
| Focus         | Macro-centric (Group)                | Micro-centric (Individual)       |
| Data Type     | Quantitative                        | Qualitative                      |
| Examples      | EPQ, 16PFQ                           | Case Studies, Unstructured Interviews |

*   **Nomothetic:** Studies groups to identify general laws of behavior.
*   **Idiographic:** Focuses on the uniqueness of an individual.
