## Approaches to Studying Personality

*   Two primary approaches: Type and Trait.
*   **Type Approach:** Broad level classification.
*   **Trait Approach:** Specific, more focused on certain characteristics.

### Type Approach: Key Types and Philosophies

*   **Goal:** Understand personality by examining broad patterns in behavior.

#### 1. Hippocrates

*   Based on fluids present in the body.
*   Four types:
    *   **Sanguine:** (Utsahi - Enthusiastic) Excess Blood
        *   Active, Energetic, Optimistic

### Trait Approach

*   **Goal:** Discover building blocks of personality - specific psychological attributes.
*   Focuses on differences *between* individuals.
*   These traits should be relatively stable over time.

#### Characteristics

*   **Stability:** Relatively stable over time.
*   **Consistency:** Consistent across situations.
*   **Strength Variation:** Strength and combination of traits vary across individuals.
*   **Individual Differences:** Leads to individual differences in personality.

#### 1. Allport's Trait Theory

*   Categorizes traits into three groups:
    *   **Cardinal Traits:** (Dominating Traits)
        *   Highly generalized dispositions, Define a person's life goal, Associated with the person's name (e.g., Gandhi's Non-Violence).
    *   **Central Traits:** (General Traits)
        *   Generalized dispositions, Less pervasive, Form the main personality (e.g., Honesty, Altruism).
    *   **Secondary Traits:** (Situational Traits)
        *   Least generative, May only be evident in certain situations (e.g., Liking ethnic clothes, Nervousness before public speaking).

#### 2. Raymond Cattell's Classification

*   16 Primary Factor Questionnaire (16PFQ)
*   Divides personality factors into:
    *   **Source Traits:**
        *   More stable, Building blocks of personality (e.g., Emotional stability).
    *   **Surface Traits:**
        *   Visible, Result from interaction of Source Traits (e.g., Honesty).

#### 3. Eysenck's Trait Theory

*   Based on biological/genetic factors.
*   Two broad dimensions (later expanded to three):

        *   Psychoticism (High): Hostile, Egocentric, Anti-social.
        *   Socialization (High): Cooperative, Altruistic, Empathetic.

#### 4. Five-Factor Model (Big Five)

*   Developed by Paul Costa and Robert McCrae.
*   Five broad dimensions: (OCEAN)

        *   Low: Well-adjusted, Stable.
*   **Conclusion:**
    *   The Five-Factor Model is useful in understanding personality profiles across cultures and is considered a prominent empirical approach to the study of personality.

## Assessment of Personality

*   **Definition:** Formal effort to understand personality, predict behavior with minimum error and maximum accuracy.
*   Three Basic Divisions:
    *   Self-Report Measures
    *   Projective Techniques
    *   Behavioral Analysis

### Comparison: Self-Report vs. Projective Techniques

| Feature          | Self-Report Measures           | Projective Techniques         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Nature           | Direct                          | Indirect                        |
| Reliability      | Less Reliable                   | More Reliable                 |
| Subjectivity     | Subjective                       | Objective                     |

### Self-Report Measures

*   Involve direct questions answered by the individual.
*   Examples:
    *   MMPI (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory)
    *   16PFQ (Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire)
    *   Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ)

#### 1. MMPI (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory)

*   Developed by Hathaway and McKinley (1943).
*   Tool for psychiatric diagnosis.
*   567 questions (True/False), divided into 10 sub-scales.
*   Used in diagnosing psychological abnormalities (e.g., Depression, Social Introversion).
*   Indian adaptation: Jodhpur Multiphasic Personality Inventory (JMPI).

#### 2. 16PFQ (Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire)

*   Developed by Raymond Cattell.
*   164 statements.
*   Useful for career guidance and vocational exploration for students and adults.

#### 3. Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ)

*   Developed by Hans Eysenck and Sybil Eysenck (1975).
*   Based on 32 traits.
*   Revised version (EPQR) with full (100 questions) and short (48 questions) versions.

#### Problems with Self-Report Measures

*   Can be unreliable; answers may be influenced by social desirability.

### Projective Techniques

*   Access unconscious motives and feelings.
*   Examples:
    *   Rorschach Inkblot Test
    *   Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)
    *   Sentence Completion Test
    *   Rosenzweig Picture-Frustration Study
    *   Draw-a-Person Test

#### 1. Rorschach Inkblot Test

*   10 inkblot cards (5 Black & White, 2 Red, 3 Colourful).
*   Subject responds to the images on the cards.
*   Two phases:
    *   *Performance Proper*: What the subject sees in each card.
    *   *Inquiry*: Where, how, and why the subject gave a particular response.

#### 2. Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)

*   Developed by Christiana Morgan and Henry Murray (1930s).
*   31 cards (30 picture cards, 1 blank).
*   Subject creates a short story based on each picture.
*   Assesses personality based on the story content.
*   *Apperception:* How new experiences are assimilated and transformed by residues of past experiences.
*   Analysis focuses on:
    *   Hero (protagonist) and their needs.
    *   Press (environmental forces).
    *   Thema (interaction between hero and press).
    *   Outcome (of the story).
*   Indian version developed by Uma Chaudhari.

#### 3. Sentence Completion Test

*   Incomplete sentences are presented; subject completes them.
*   Completed sentences are used to assess personality.
*   Considered a semi-projective method.

#### 4. Rosenzweig Picture-Frustration Study

*   24 cartoon pictures depicting a frustrating situation.
*   Subject describes the response of the frustrated person.
*   Provides information about how people express aggression in frustrating situations.
*   Indian version developed by Uday Pareek.

#### 5. Draw-a-Person Test

*   Subject draws a person.
*   Certain characteristics of the drawing (e.g., large hands, big head) are interpreted as indicators of specific personality traits.

### Behavioral Analysis Techniques

*   Analyzes a person's behavior in different situations.
*   Examples:
    *   Interview
    *   Observation
    *   Situation Test (SRT - Situation Reaction Test)
    *   Nomination

#### 1. Interview

*   Structured (fixed questions) or Unstructured (open-ended questions).

#### 2. Observation

*   A trained observer notes the individual's behavior, gestures, posture, body language.

#### 3. Situation Test (Situation Reaction Test - SRT)

*   The person is placed in a specific situation, and their behavior is studied.

#### 4. Nomination

*   Peer assessment: People who know the individual well are asked to describe their personality or choose them for specific tasks.

## Nomothetic vs. Idiographic Approaches

| Feature       | Nomothetic Approach                  | Idiographic Approach            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Meaning       | "Custom" or "Law"                     | "One's Own," "Private"           |
| Focus         | Macro-centric (Group)                | Micro-centric (Individual)       |
| Data Type     | Quantitative                        | Qualitative                      |
| Examples      | EPQ, 16PFQ                           | Case Studies, Unstructured Interviews |

*   **Nomothetic:** Studies groups to identify general laws of behavior.
*   **Idiographic:** Focuses on the uniqueness of an individual.
