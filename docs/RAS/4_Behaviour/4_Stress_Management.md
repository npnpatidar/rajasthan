    *   **Stress as a Transaction  Process:** 
	    * Stress is **not an inherent factor in an individual or environment** but involves **individuals interacting with the environment**.
        *   Appraisals of Stress (**Lazarus- Faulkman**): Response to stressful situation depends on the perceived events and their appraisals.

	            * Appraisal of available resources.
	            * Assessing one's ability and resources to cope with the situation.
    *   **Stress as a Stimulus:**  (**Holmes and Rahe**): Stress is an independent variable and a cause of experience rather than the experience itself.
