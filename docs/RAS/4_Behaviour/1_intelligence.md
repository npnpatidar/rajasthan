## Types of Intelligence

### 1. Cognitive Intelligence (संज्ञानात्मक बुद्धि)

*   It's the ability to **learn, remember, reason, solve problems, and differentiate between concepts.**  Also includes the ability to **learn languages and communicate.**
*   **Jean Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development (1970):**  A foundational theory.
    *   Piaget studied children and concluded that as a child's age and field of work increase, their intelligence also develops.
    *   He proposed four stages of cognitive development:
        1.  **Sensorimotor Stage:** (0-2 years)
        2.  **Preoperational Stage:** (2-7 years)
        3.  **Concrete Operational Stage:** (7-11 years)
        4.  **Formal Operational Stage:** (11+ years)

### 2. Social Intelligence (सामाजिक बुद्धि)

### 3. Emotional Intelligence (भावनात्मक बुद्धि)

*   The ability to understand one's own and others' emotions and thoughts, and to act accordingly.
*   **Howard Gardner's "Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences" (1983):**
    *   Introduced the concept of multiple intelligences, including:
        *   **Intrapersonal Intelligence:**  Understanding one's own feelings, strengths, and weaknesses.  Curious to know about their real identities. (Example: Spiritual leaders, philosophers)
        *   **Interpersonal Intelligence:**  Being sensitive to others' behavior, understanding their motives, and building good relationships. (Example: Politicians, religious leaders)
*   **Salovey and Mayer (1990), "Emotional Intelligence" (article):**
    *   Defined emotional intelligence as the ability to understand one's own and others' emotions, differentiate between them, and use this information to guide thinking and behavior.
*    **Salovey and Mayer, "What is Emotional Intelligence?" (1997) - PUUM model.**
    *   EI as the ability to: 
	    * **P**erceive, 
	    * **U**se,

	    * **M**anage emotions (one's own and others).
*   **Daniel Goleman, "Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ":**
    *   Proposed the "Theory of Performance."
    *   Argued that EI is *not* a trait (not solely hereditary) but can be acquired.

**Characteristics of Emotional Intelligence (Based on Salovey and Mayer's work):**

*   Perceiving, understanding, and being sensitive to one's own feelings and emotions.

*   **Vygotsky:**  Distinguishes between two types of mental actions:
    *   **Primary Mental Actions:** Universal and not affected by the surrounding environment (e.g., crying of children).
    *   **Higher Mental Actions:**  A product of culture (e.g., thinking ability, mathematical solutions).

**Western vs. Non-Western (Oriental/Occidental) Views on Intelligence:**

| Feature             | Western Countries                       | Non-Western Countries                    |

## Additional Concepts

*   **Thorndike's Intelligence Theory:**  Proposed three types of intelligence:
    *   **Social Intelligence:**  Understanding others and behaving skillfully with them.

    *   **Abstract Intelligence:** Understanding and explaining mathematical and verbal sciences, symbols, and phenomena (e.g., artists, philosophers).

*   **Effect of Heredity and Environment on Intelligence:**
    *   Research on identical twins:
        *   Reared together: Correlation of 0.90 in intelligence.
        *   Reared apart: Correlation of 0.72.  This shows the environment's influence.
    *   Adopted children:  Initially, their intelligence resembles biological parents, but over time, it becomes similar to adoptive parents.
    *   **Conclusion:** Intelligence is a complex interaction of heredity and environment.

*   **Intelligence in the Indian Context:**
    *   Emphasis on *integrated intelligence*, focusing on connectivity with the social and world environment.
    *   Includes the following capacities:
        *   **Cognitive Competence:** Understanding, discrimination, problem-solving, effective communication.
