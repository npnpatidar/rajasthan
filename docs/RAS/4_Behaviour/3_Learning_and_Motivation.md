## Learning: Definition

*   **NCERT** Definition: Any relatively permanent change in behavior or behavioral potential produced by practice and experience is called learning.

*   **Calvin's** Definition: Learning is a modification in a ready-made behavior due to experience.

*   **Skinner's** Definition: Learning is the process of progressive behavior adaptation.

## Features of Learning

*   **Change in Behavior:** Learning leads to a change in behavior.
*   **Relatively Stable:** These changes are relatively stable (not always permanent).
*   **Internal & External Changes:** Changes can be both internal and external.
*   **Creative Synthesis:** Learning is a creative synthesis of knowledge and experience.

## Styles of Learning

*   Styles are methods used by learners to make learning easier and more interesting.
*   Learning styles are derived from three main things:
    *   **Perceptual Modality:** Biologically based reaction to the physical environment (e.g., visual, auditory, tactile).
    *   **Information Processing:** How we think, solve problems, and remember information (how sensory information is processed).
    *   **Personality Pattern:** How personality affects interaction with the environment and individual responses.

### Learning Styles derived from:

#### 1. Perceptual Modality:

*   Preference for receiving information.
*   Examples: Visual, Auditory, Tactile learners.

#### 2. Information Processing:

*   How we think, solve problems, and remember information.
*   Serial vs. Simultaneous processing.

#### 3. Personality Pattern:

*   Preferred way of organizing, perceiving, and retaining information.
*   Focuses on how personality affects interaction with the environment and individual responses.

### Learning Styles (Anderson):

*   **Relational Style:** (Often associated with Arts Students)
    *   Learns the total single whole unit of information.
    *   Easily learns social content.
    *   Good memory for verbal information.
    *   Non-Academic task-oriented.
    *   Influenced by authority opinion.
    *   Withdraws from non-stimulating tasks.
    *   Conflicts with traditional school style.
*   **Analytical Style:** (Often associated with Science Students)
    *   Learns information in small chunks.
    *   Easily learns impersonal content.
    *   Good memory for abstract ideas.
    *   Academic task-oriented.
    *   Not affected by opinions of others.
    *   Shows the ability to persist in non-stimulating tasks.
    *   Matches mostly with school style.

### Kolb's Learning Styles:

*   Four Styles based on a diagram with axes of Feeling, Watching, Thinking, and Doing.
    *   **Diverging:** (Feeling & Watching)
        *   Prefers watching over doing, Imagines solutions, Works in groups, Listens to ideas.
    *   **Assimilating:** (Watching & Thinking)
        *   Concise, Logical approach, Prioritizes ideas and concepts.
    *   **Converging:** (Thinking & Doing)
        *   Interested in practical solutions, Prioritizes technical tasks.
    *   **Accommodating:** (Feeling & Doing)
        *   Intuition-based, Takes initiative and depends on trial and error rather than logic. Uses analysis from others and Attracted to New Challenges and is the Most common in general public.

## Memory

*   **Definition:** Ability to retain or recall information.
*   Psychological process of retaining and recalling information over a period of time.
*   Three Independent Stages:
    *   **Encoding:** Extracting meaning from information.
    *   **Storage:** Storing the encoded information for later use.
    *   **Retrieval:** Bringing stored information to awareness when needed.

### Memory Stages: Detailed

*   **Encoding:**
    *   Information is received and registered.
    *   Extract meaning so the memory system can reuse it.

*   **Storage:**
    *   Storing the encoded information so it can be used later.
    *   Retaining and holding information over a period of time.
    *   Completes the consolidation process of memory.

*   **Retrieval:**
    *   Bringing stored information to awareness.
    *   Used for performing various cognitive tasks.

### Models of Memory

#### 1. Stage Model of Memory (Atkinson & Shiffrin):

*   Three basic forms of memory:
    *   **Sensory Memory:**
        *   Registers information from each sense.
        *   Exact replica of stimulus.
        *   Large storage capacity.
        *   Very short duration (less than a second).
    *   **Short-Term Memory (STM):**
        *   Information from sensory memory that is given attention.
        *   Duration: Less than 30 seconds.
        *   Information is lost if not practiced.
        *   Capacity is large
        *   Information is primarily encoded acoustically (in terms of sound).
    *   **Long-Term Memory (LTM):**
        *   Information from STM that is rehearsed/elaborated on.
        *   Permanent storehouse.
        *   Lifetime duration.
        *   Unlimited storage capacity.

### Control Processes of Memory (Atkinson & Shiffrin)
*   **Selective Attention:** Decides which information will travel from Sensory Memory to Short Term Memory.
*   **Maintenance Rehearsal (and Chunking):** Retains information in Short Term Memory for a longer time through repetition and through breaking into chunks of smaller sizes to better recall.
*   **Elaborative Rehearsal:** Moves information from Short Term Memory to Long Term Memory and deep thinking and memorizing.

#### 2. Working Memory Model (Lloving)

*   Working Memory Model divide long-term memory into two components:
    *   **Explicit Memory (Declarative Memory):**
    *   **Episodic:** Memory of personal experiences (e.g., being scolded by mother, first day of school).
    *   **Semantic:** General factual information (e.g., 2 + 4 = 6, Prime Minister of India).
    *   **Implicit Memory (Procedural Memory):**
        *   Memory of learned skills (e.g., cycling, making tea).

#### 3. Bartlett Model of Memory:

*   Memory is an active process that changes according to one's prejudices, experiences, and requirements.
*   **Schema:** Organization of past experiences and knowledge that influences how incoming information is interpreted, stored, and retrieved.

#### 4. Craik & Lockhart's Levels of Processing Theory:

*   Two levels of processing determine memory retention:
    *   **Shallow Processing:**
        *   Attention to physical characteristics.
        *   Structural and phonological analysis.
        *   Short-term retention.
    *   **Deep Processing:**
        *   Interpretation at a deeper level.
        *   Semantic and elaborative analysis.
        *   Long-term retention.

## Forgetting (Vismarana)

*   **Definition:** The process of losing any previously learned experience or retained information due to some reason.
*   Ebbinghaus's Forgetting Curve: The amount of retention decreases as the time gap between learning and retention increases.

*   Equation: Amount Retained is inversely proportional to Time since learning.
*   Initially, there is a sharp decline in memory, but the rate of decline gradually slows down over time.

### Theories and Factors of Forgetting

*   **Decay or Disuse Principle (Ebbinghaus):** Memory traces disappear over time due to lack of practice or use.
*   **Theory of Interference:** Associations established between different items interfere with each other during retrieval.
    *   **Proactive Interference:** Previously learned information interferes with the recall of new information.
    *   **Retroactive Interference:** New information interferes with the recall of old information.
*   **Encoding Failure:** Information is not properly encoded, making it difficult to retrieve.
*   **Consolidation Failure:** Encoded information is not consolidated, leading to failure of long-term memory formation.
*   **Retrieval Failure (Tulving):** The failure to use information stored in long-term memory in a timely manner due to the absence of retrieval cues. Retrieval cues helps us to retrieve stored information from our Long-Term-Memory.
*   **Motivated Forgetting (Freud):** Forgetting information that we want to forget due to anxiety or guilt (e.g., traumatic experiences like eve-teasing).

## Enhancing Memory

*   Techniques for improving memory.
*   *Mnemonic Devices:* Formal strategies used to enhance retention of information.
*   Examples:
    *   **Using Images:** Visual aids to help to remember information for longer.
    *   **Using Organization:**
        *   **Chunking:** Dividing information into smaller units and better memorizing.
        *   **First-Letter Technique:** Using the first letter of each word to create a memory aid (e.g., VIBGYOR).
    *   **Engaging in Deep-Level Processing:** Processing information at a deeper, semantic level.
    *   **Minimizing Interference:** Avoiding learning too much similar information at once.
    *   **Moving Enough Retrieval Cues:** Using cues to prompt memory retrieval.
    *   **PQ4R Method:** *Preview, Question, Read, Reflect, Recite, Review*.

## Assessment of Motivation

*   **Definition:** An attempt to assess the motivational elements or factors of a person.
*   Methods of Motivation Assessment:
    *   **Questionnaire Method:** Using questionnaires with questions to assess motivation levels (e.g., MMPI, 16PFQ).
    *   **Projective Techniques:** Using random or unstructured materials to assess motivation based on the individual's responses.
    *   **Analysis of Historical Events:** Obtaining information about social motives from newspapers and historical events.
    *   **Situational Test:** Presenting individuals with a situation and assessing their reactions.
    *   **Measurement of Activity Level:** Assessing motivation based on the intensity of an individual's responses and expressions.
    *   **Selection Method:** Assessing motivation based on the choices individuals make among available options.
    *   **Interference Method:** Assessing motivation by observing an individual's persistence in completing a task despite repeated failures.
