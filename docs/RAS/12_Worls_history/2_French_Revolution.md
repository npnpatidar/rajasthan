# French Revolution
## **Causes of the French Revolution:**

*   **Social Causes**:
    *   *Rigid Social Hierarchy (Ancien Régime)*: Society divided into three estates (clergy, nobility, commoners), with unequal rights and privileges. *This rigid structure fueled resentment, particularly among the Third Estate.*
    *   *Growing Middle Class (Bourgeoisie)*: Wealthy but lacked political power, resented aristocratic privilege. *They increasingly embraced Enlightenment ideas about equality and representation.*
    *   *Peasant Grievances*: High taxes, feudal dues, and land shortages led to widespread poverty and discontent. *Peasants formed the majority of the population and were the most heavily burdened.*
    *   *Urban Poor*: High unemployment, rising food prices, and lack of social safety nets caused hardship and unrest in cities. *This created a volatile and easily mobilized population.*

*   **Economic Causes**:
    *   *Extravagant Royal Spending*: Lavish court at Versailles drained the treasury. *This fueled popular anger towards the monarchy.*
    *   *Debt Crisis*: Result of wars (e.g., American Revolution) and inefficient tax system. *The debt crisis forced Louis XVI to call the Estates-General, triggering the Revolution.*
    *   *Tax Burden on the Third Estate*: Commoners bore the brunt of taxation, while clergy and nobility were largely exempt. *This injustice was a major source of resentment.*
    *   *Poor Harvests*: Led to food shortages, rising prices, and famine, exacerbating social unrest. *These crises heightened tensions and contributed to revolutionary fervor.*

*   **Political Causes**:
    *   *Absolute Monarchy*: Louis XVI's weak leadership and resistance to reform. *His inability to address the mounting problems fueled calls for change.*
    *   *Ineffective Government*: Inefficient administration, corruption, and lack of representation for the Third Estate. *This bred distrust and a desire for more responsive governance.*
    *   *Failure of Reforms*: Attempts at reform (e.g., by Turgot and Necker) were blocked by the nobility. *This demonstrated the monarchy's inability to enact meaningful change.*

*   **Ideological Causes**:
    *   *Enlightenment Ideas*: Philosophers like Rousseau, Voltaire, and Montesquieu advocated for natural rights, popular sovereignty, and separation of powers. *These ideas provided a intellectual framework for challenging the legitimacy of the monarchy and the Ancien Régime.*
    *   *Influence of the American Revolution*: Demonstrated the possibility of successful revolution against monarchy and inspired calls for liberty and equality. *The American example served as a powerful catalyst for change.*
