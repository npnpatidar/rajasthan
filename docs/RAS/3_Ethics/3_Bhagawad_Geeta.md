## Core Teachings

### 1. Nishkam Karma Yoga (Selfless Action)

- **Popular Teaching:** Considered the most famous teaching.
- **Misinterpretation:** Often misinterpreted as "act without desire for results."
- **Correct Interpretation:** "Act without attachment to the results." Focus on performing your duty, not controlling the outcome.
- **Key Principles:**
  - Right to action, not fruits.
  - Action should not be abandoned.
  - Results may not align with your will.
- **Comparison to Duty Ethics (Kant):** Similar principles of acting based on duty, without concern for personal outcomes.
- **Swadharma:** Following one's duty according to the _varna_ (caste) system (based on duties, not birth).
  - Four divisions based on duties:
    - Brahmin
    - Kshatriya
    - Vaishya
    - Shudra
  - Following _swadharma_ is superior, even in death, compared to following _pardharma_ (another's duty).
- **Nishkam Karma vs. Sakam Karma:**
  - **Nishkam Karma:** Action performed without attachment or ego; leads to salvation and public welfare. Considered "Akarma" because the law of karma doesn't apply.
  - **Sakam Karma:** Action performed with attachment to results and ego; leads to bondage.
    - Types of Sakam Karma:
      - Sanchita Karma: past life karma not yet fruited.
      - Prarabdha Karma: Karma of previous life, giving the present life.
      - Sanchayamaan Karma: Karma of the present life.

### 2. Yoga

- **Meaning:** Union of the soul with the Supreme Soul.
- **Key Phrase:** _Yoga Karmasu Kaushalam_ (Skill in action is Yoga). Performing actions well is yoga.
- _Samattvam Yoga Uchyate_ (Equanimity is yoga). Achieving a state of mental calmness.
- Various types of Yoga mentioned (Karma Yoga, Jnana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Sankhya Yoga, etc.).

    - **Rajasic:** Energy, fulfilling desires, actions, anger, greed.
    - **Tamasic:** Negative qualities, lethargy, excessive sleep, ignorance.

### 3. Anasakti (Non-Attachment)

- A _Stitha Pragnya_ remains the same in happiness, pain, pleasure, success, and failure.

- When _adharma_ (unrighteousness) rises and _dharma_ (righteousness) declines, God incarnates to protect the good, destroy evil, and re-establish _dharma_.
- Civil servants should protect society and destroy "evil services."

### 8. Rajarishi
