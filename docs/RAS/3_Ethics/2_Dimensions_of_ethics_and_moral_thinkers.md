## Dimensions of Ethics (नीतिशास्त्र के आयाम)

**Two Main Bases for Division:**

1. **On the Basis of Branches:**

   - Normative Ethics (नियम कीय नीतिशास्त्र)
   - Meta-Ethics (अधि नीति शास्त्र)
   - Applied Ethics (व्यवहारिक नीतिशास्त्र)

2. **On the Basis of Modern Ideologies:**
   - Marxist (Karl Marx's Philosophy)
   - Feminist
   - Black Ethics (Black Skin Color - US Context)
   - Freudian (Sigmund Freud's Philosophy)

**Detailed Breakdown (Branches - Most Important):**

### Normative Ethics (नियम कीय नीतिशास्त्र) - MOST IMPORTANT

- **Divisions:**
  - **Deontological Ethics / Duty Ethics:** (परिणाम निरपेक्षता)
    - Emphasis on duty, not consequences. Act is moral if done out of duty, regardless of outcome.
  - **Teleological Ethics / Consequentialism:** (परिणाम सापेक्षता)
    - Focus on the consequences of an action. The morality of an act is determined by its outcome.
  - **Virtue Ethics:** (सद्गुण नीति शास्त्र)
    - Focus on character. Moral actions are those that a virtuous person would do. Look at lives and values of virtuous people.

**Key Thinkers/Concepts within Normative Ethics**

- **Deontological:**
  - **Immanuel Kant:** Emphasis on duty. (Kant = Duty)
  - **Bhagavad Gita:** कर्मण्य वाद वास्तु - Focus on action without attachment to results. Separate chapter on this.
  - **Intuitionism:** Intrinsic moral knowledge. People inherently know what is right and wrong. Act according to your intuition.
- **Teleological:**
  - **Egoism (स्वार्थ वाद):** Self-interest is the basis of morality. Humans are inherently selfish.
  - **Hedonism (सुखवादी):** Pleasure is the ultimate good. Seek pleasure and avoid pain. (Charvaka Philosophy - "Yavat Jivet Sukham Jivet" - live happily as long as you live)
  - **Utilitarianism (उपयोगितावाद):** Maximize happiness for the greatest number of people.
  - **Evolutionism:** Moral values evolve over time, becoming better.
- **Virtue Ethics:**
  - **Socrates**
  - **Plato**
  - **Aristotle**
  - So the important ones here are Socrates, Plato and Aristotle.
  - Mention of Sophists (less important) - existed before Socrates.
  - Confucius & Taoism (Chinese thinkers) - mentioned but deemed less important for this syllabus; just remember the names.

### Meta-Ethics (अधि नीति शास्त्र)

- Analytic study of ethical issues.
- Related to the following topics in the syllabus: Duty, Good, Virtue, "Rit" (रित), "Rin" (ऋण).

### Applied Ethics (व्यवहारिक नीतिशास्त्र)

- Application of moral principles to specific fields.
- Examples: Medical Ethics, Sports Ethics, Business Ethics, Administrative Ethics.
- Moral rules are general, but in the application in each of these fields are very specific.
- **Example of Medical Ethics:** Hospital falsely prolonging a deceased patient's life on paper to increase billing is unethical.
- **Environmental Ethics:** Moral evaluation of the relationship between humans and the environment.

### Modern Ideologies

**Marxist Ethics (Karl Marx)**

- **Objective:** Establish equality in society.
- The "means" are secondary to the "ends."
- **Core Tenets:**

  - Constant "Class Struggle" between them.
  - Current moral rules are defined by the Bourgeoisie to serve their interests.
  - Redefinition of moral rules is necessary. Violence for the sake of equality is justified.
  - Criticizes Religion, Nation, State, and Traditional Family Structure.
- **Quote to Remember:** "Religion is the opiate of the masses."

**Feminist Ethics**

- Morality is NOT based on skin color.
- "Black Lives Matter" movement.
- Black people should not feel inferior due to skin color.
- "Black is Beautiful."

  - Conscious (Tip of the iceberg)
  - Unconscious, Subconscious (Largely submerged)
- **Personality:** Id, Ego, Superego
  - **Id:** Basic urges (hunger, thirst, sexual desires). Pleasure principle. Instant gratification.
  - **Superego:** Developed social morality. How society wants you to behave. Morality principle.
  - **Ego:** Balances Id and Superego. Reality principle. The "Real" personality.
- **Example:** Desire to go to Goa.
  - Id: Go to Goa, no problem!
  - Superego: No, exam! Cannot go.
  - Ego: Maybe a trip nearby, not too far.

## Virtue Ethics: The Sophists

  - Appetite -> Temperance
- **Purpose of Virtues:**
  - Wisdom: Helps distinguish between right and wrong, and make right decisions.
  - Courage: Inspires a person to face difficult problems.
  - Temperance: Controls senses/desires.
- **Achieving Justice:** Requires balancing these three virtues. Act according to your dominant virtue.

#### Justice in Society/State

- **Division of Society into Three Classes (similar to the Varna system in India):**

- Jeremy Bentham
- John Stuart Mill (JS Mill)

#### 3.2.1. Jeremy Bentham

- **Background:** Prominent English thinker.
- **Key Idea:** "Maximum Happiness for Maximum Number of People." _Important, must include if Bentham's name is mentioned_. He is often considered to have started Utilitarianism.
- **Hedonistic Utilitarianism:**
  - Accepted psychological, ethical, and altruistic hedonism.
- **Contradiction:**
  - Bentham identifies a contradiction in the idea that individuals are selfish from birth, so he does not explain why people act in the way they do.

### 3.3. Criticisms of Utilitarianism

- Happiness is _subjective_ and difficult to define.
- Constantly thinking about happiness may prevent achieving it.
- "Maximum happiness for maximum number of people" _does not protect the interests of minorities_.
- Actions performed under pressure are not truly ethical.
- Happiness is difficult or impossible to measure.
- Mill's qualitative differences in happiness lack a clear explanation of what makes happiness "superior" or "inferior."
- Ethical Hedonism has a naturalistic fallacy. A person's natural tendancies cannot be ethical.

- Disagreements: Accepts the mechanical relationship between individual and society but gives importance to individual liberty.
- Stephen accepts the organic relationship between individual and society.
- Body parts can be sacrificed to protect the body, so the same goes to protecting the individuals of society. Society should be held to a higher importance.
- Criticizes absolute morality as an imaginary world.

- **Three Stages of Morality:**
  1. **Initial Stage:** Stage of Subjective consciousness. Individual Interest, Conflict to the social state. Prioritization to self-interest. State enaction of Laws.
  2. **Stage of Self-Inspiration:** Objective Consciousness. Society and Individual Interest are aligned.
  3. **Final Stage:** Absolute Consciousness. The individual and society becomes one. and the individual works for Social Interest Only.
- **Theory of Dialectics:** The Idea is to achieve perfection.

- Identification for Social interest and small since Everyone contributes to it.

# Existentialism, Deontology, and John Rawls' Theory of Justice

## I. Existentialism

- Focuses on human existence.
- Logical and Virtue Ethics are already covered.

### A. Soeren Kierkegaard

- Considered a founder of Existentialism (along with Nietzsche).
- A religious thinker who emphasized human existence.
- **Critiques Materialism:**
  - Argues humans seek happiness in material things.
  - This leads to a reduction in emotions and sensitivity.
  - Humans start to identify themselves with material things
- **Three Stages of Life:**
  1. **Aesthetic Stage:** Happiness gained from material possessions. This is temporary.
  2. **Ethical Stage:** Happiness through working for society and increased social prestige. This, too, is temporary.
  3. **Religious Stage:** Human becomes spiritual, surrounds themselves with God, and achieves long-term peace.
- **Note:** Stages can occur in parallel or as an evolution.

### B. Jean-Paul Sartre

- Individualistic thinker emphasizing human existence.
- Importance in human existence
- **Rejects the existence of God** to protect the existence of human beings.
- **Essence and Decisions:** Human beings create their essence through decisions.
- **"Man is condemned to be free."** It's man's basic nature.
- **Being vs. Becoming:**
  - **Being:** A state where one is free to make their own decisions.
  - **Becoming:** A state of being a slave to external forces, unable to decide one's utility.
  - If a person doesn't take their own decisions, they move from "Being" to "Becoming."

## II. Deontology (Duty Ethics)

- Emphasis on duty and moral obligations.
- Often referred to as Duty Ethics.

### A. Bhagavad Gita

- A primary text of Duty Ethics. (To be covered later)

### B. Immanuel Kant

- German philosopher known for rigorous and structured thinking.
- **Emphasis on "Will":** Actions should be evaluated based on the _will_ behind them, not their consequences.
- **Goodwill vs. Bad Will:**
  - **Goodwill:** Inspired by a spirit of duty, is moral. Acts performed with goodwill are ethical.
  - **Bad Will:** Inspired by emotions, is unethical.
- **Categorical Imperative:**
  - Moral rules should be strictly followed without exception.
  - Moral rules are the _end_ itself, not a means to a higher objective.
  - "Observance of duty _is_ duty." ("Duty for duty's sake.")
- **Hypothetical Imperative:**
  - Moral rules are followed to achieve a higher objective (opposed by Kant).
- **Four Formulas for Morality (to be used when formulating moral rules):**
  1. **Law of Universality:** Moral rules must be universally applicable, without exceptions, regardless of place, time, or person.
  2. **Law of Considering Man as an End:** All actions and moral rules should treat humans as ends in themselves, not as means. Humanity should be respected.
  3. **Law of Autonomy:** Each individual is inherently free; therefore, moral rules shouldn't be externally imposed. Moral rules should be decided by the person themselves. (Rejection of state and law concepts).
  4. **Law Maker of Kingdom of Ends:** Integration of the above three laws.
- **Two Aspects of Human Beings:**
  1. **Rational Aspect:** Inspires one to follow the path of duty.
  2. **Emotional Aspect:** Deviates one from the path of duty.
  - To achieve morality, a person should strengthen the rational aspect and control the emotional aspect.
- **Postulates/Pre-assumptions of Morality:**
  1. **Freedom of Will:** Every person is free to make their own decisions and is responsible for them.
  2. **Immortality of Soul:** God and soul cannot be proven empirically (transcendental subjects). To establish morality, one must accept the immortality of the soul and rebirth. Life is limited, and absolute morality cannot be achieved in one lifetime.
  3. **Existence of God:** Cannot be proven through evidence, but God must be assumed to exist, because God gives pleasure, by which Good will transforms into absolute will.
- **Critiques of Kant:**
  - Completely ignores consequences.
  - Ethics are too strict and impractical.
  - Doesn't accept exceptions.
  - Doesn't give importance to emotions.
  - Accepts God and Soul, which cannot be proven.

## III. Intuitionism (Antah Pragya Vaad)

- Ethical actions are those done as per one's intuition.
- Intuition is a kind of direct knowledge whose source is undefined.

### A. Ralph Cudworth and Samuel Clarke

- Intuition is generated through pure reason, not experience or the senses.
- Intuition exists in all human beings, allowing them to make ethical decisions.
- Intuition is compared to mathematics (e.g., a triangle's angles always summing to 180 degrees).

### B. Shaftesbury and Hutcheson

- **Theory of Moral Sense:** Accepts the role of emotions and experience.
- Moral sense develops like aesthetic sense.
- Continuous exposure to moral problems can sharpen one's moral sense.

### C. Joseph Butler

- Accepts the role of both reason and emotion.
- **Conscience:**
  - Cognitive aspect helps in knowing right and wrong.

## IV. John Rawls

- American political philosopher.
- **Theory of Justice:** Book written to critique existing theories of justice.
- **Justice as Fairness:** Justice is fundamentally about fairness.
- **Problem:** How to distribute goods like liberty, opportunity, and equality fairly.
- **Critique of Utilitarianism:** Interest of the minority is not protected, and the consent of all is not taken.
- **Social Contract Theory:**
  - To formulate a theory of justice, a process should be used where the consent of everyone is taken.
  - Help from Social Contract Theory (Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau) can be taken.
  - State came into existence through this theory.
  - Explains how rational individuals come together to form a society with agreed-upon rules.
- **Original Position and Veil of Ignorance:**
  - **Original Position:** All rational individuals gather in an imaginary place.
  - **Veil of Ignorance:** Each individual is placed behind a "veil" that conceals their status, capabilities, and future plans.
    - This ensures they create moral rules and a theory of justice that considers the equality, liberty, and protection of all, including the weakest.
    - **Important Term:** _Veil of Ignorance_.
- **Society as a Chain:** Society should protect the weaker link. (analogous to the weakest link in a chain).
