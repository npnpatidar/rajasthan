## Rta (ऋत) - The Cosmic Order

- **Unique Concept:** Rta is presented as a unique concept primarily found in Indian philosophy, with no direct equivalent or discussion in Western philosophy.
- **Origin:** Rooted in the observations of ancient sages, it describes the inherent order and regularity in the universe.
- **Examples:**
  - The predictable rising of the sun.
  - The consistent phases of the moon.
  - The cyclical nature of seasons.
- **Philosophical Layers:**
  1. **Universal Order:** Rta governs the astronomical and natural world, representing an unbreakable cosmic order.
  2. **Dharma (धर्म):** When Rta is applied to human society, it becomes Dharma – the principle of maintaining order and righteousness in social structures, mirroring the universal order.
  3. **Karma (कर्म):** When Dharma is internalized and applied to individual actions, it manifests as Karma – the concept of actions and their consequences.
- **Quotes & Significance:**
  - "धर्मो रक्षति रक्षितः" - (dharmo rakshati rakshitah): "If you protect Dharma, Dharma will protect you."
  - "जो जिस करे तास फल पावे": "As you sow, so shall you reap."
  - "ऋतस्य यथा प्रेत": "Act according to Rta"
  - Dr. S. Radhakrishnan defined dharma as not just the religious texts such as Vedas, Upanishads, Quran, or Bible. Rather, it is following rules and order in general, such as following traffic rules on road
- **Ethics Definition:** Rta is a Vedic concept that governs natural, moral and ritualistic order of universe
- Ṛta cannot be violated without consequence; those who transgress it face punishment.
- Varun is protector of Rta. 
- Duties of every individual in society is decided, because of which moral order of society is maintained.
- **Administration Relevance:**  Public welfare depends on maintaining public order. Administrative systems with constitutions, laws, rules, and regulations are all based on establishing and protecting order. Everyone should fulfill their duties to uphold this order.


## Rina (ऋण) - Debt and Obligation

- **Concept:** Rina translates to "debt" or "obligation."
- **Core Idea:** Individuals are inherently indebted to parents, ancestors, teachers, and God for the gift of life and the sustenance it provides.
- **Three Types of Rina:**
  1. **Pitra Rina (पितृ ऋण):** Debt towards parents and ancestors, emphasizing respect, care, and honoring their legacy. It is paid by respecting ancestors and keeping them in their memory.
  2. **Rishi Rina (ऋषि ऋण):** Debt towards teachers who impart knowledge and guide individuals on how to live a meaningful life. The debt is paid by respecting the teachers.
  3. **Deva Rina (देव ऋण):** Debt towards God for the natural order and the blessings of life. To repay, one should perform _yagna_ and prayers.
- **Consequences of Unpaid Rina:** Failure to acknowledge and repay these debts hinders spiritual progress (salvation) and can lead to suffering.
- **Three Types of Suffering:**
  1. **Adhyatmik Dukha:** Suffering arising from one's own body (e.g., headache).
  2. **Adhibhautik Dukha:** Suffering caused by other living beings (e.g., snake bite)
  3. **Adhidaivik Dukha:** Suffering due to natural causes (e.g., drought, earthquake).
- **Administration Relevance:** Civil servants should consider themselves indebted to society and fulfill their duties accordingly.

## Duty (कर्तव्य)

- **Narrow Meaning:** Legal obligations that are enforceable.
- **Broad Meaning:** Any action that should be performed, whether legally binding or personally desired, constitutes a duty.
- **Philosophical Perspectives:**
  - **Deontology (Immanuel Kant):** Emphasizes "duty for duty's sake" and acting with a sense of moral obligation.
  - **Bhagavad Gita:** Focuses on _Swadharma_ (one's own duty).
  - **Hinduism:** Four Purusharthas (Dharma, Artha, Kama, Moksha) emphasizes that each action should lead to a duty in itself.
- **Classification of Duties:**
  - **Positive vs. Negative:** What you _should_ do vs. what you _should not_ do (e.g., always tell the truth vs. never lie).
  - **Perfect vs. Imperfect:** Duties with accepted exceptions( Rights are given) vs. duties without exceptions(RIghts are not given) (e.g., to not kill vs. to be generous).
  - **Subjective vs. Objective:** Duties interpreted by an individual vs. duties uniform to all (e.g., personal spiritual practice vs. upholding the law).
  - **Legal vs. Moral:** Duties enforced by law vs. duties enforced by social norms (e.g., paying taxes vs. being honest).
- **Duties of an Individual:**
  - **Self-Regarding:** Duties related to one's own well-being (physical, intellectual, economic, moral).
  - **Other-Regarding:** Duties towards family, friends, society, nation, humanity, and nature.
  - **God-Regarding:** Religious and spiritual duties.
- **Conflict of Duties:**
  - Occurs when two or more duties contradict each other.
  - Resolution: Sacrifice the lower duty for the higher duty.
  - Guidance: Seek advice from the Constitution, laws, rules, regulations, superiors, and those with more experience to help establish the priority for each duty.
- **Relation Between Rights and Duties:**
  - Rights are claims of an individual against society.
  - Duties are claims of society against an individual.
  - Emphasis is often more in rights within capitalist societies
  - Without balance, duties without rights lead to disorder, and rights without duties lead to despotism.
- **Mahatma Gandhi's View:** Rights and duties are two sides of the same coin, and fulfilling one's duties automatically protects the rights of others.

## Good (सुख)

- **Definition:** "Good" refers to that which one desires or finds desirable, which is "sukha" in philosophy.
- **Types of Goods:**
  - **Relative Good:** A good pursued as a means to a higher end (e.g., wealth, health, social prestige).
  - **Absolute Good:** A good pursued as an end in itself, not subordinate to any other good (e.g., duty for Kant, salvation in Hinduism, Nirvana in Buddhism). In civil services, public welfare can be considered as an absolute good.
- **Knowledge of Good:** Some believe that the knowledge of what is good can be obtained through intuition.
