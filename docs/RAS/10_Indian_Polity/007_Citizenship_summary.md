### Citizenship

*   **Meaning and Significance**
    *   India has two categories of people: citizens and aliens.
    *   **Citizens:** Full members of the state, owe allegiance, enjoy all civil and political rights.
    *   **Aliens:** Citizens of another state, do not enjoy all civil and political rights.

        *   **Friendly Aliens:** From countries with cordial relations.
        *   **Enemy Aliens:** From countries at war with India; enjoy fewer rights (e.g., no protection against arrest and detention under Article 22).
*   **Rights and Privileges Conferred on Indian Citizens**
    *   Against discrimination (Article 15).
    *   Equality of opportunity in public employment (Article 16).
    *   Freedom of speech, expression, etc. (Article 19).
    *   Cultural and educational rights (Articles 29 and 30).
    *   Right to vote in Lok Sabha and state legislative assembly elections.
    *   Right to contest elections to Parliament and state legislatures.
    *   Eligibility to hold public offices like President, Vice-President, judges of Supreme and High Courts, Governors, Attorney General, and Advocate General.
*   **Duties of Citizens**
    *   Paying taxes.
    *   Respecting the national flag and anthem.

*   **Eligibility for President's Office**
    *   In India, both citizens by birth and naturalized citizens are eligible.
    *   In the USA, only citizens by birth are eligible.
*   **Single Citizenship**
    *   India follows single citizenship (Indian citizenship only) despite being a federal state. Allegiance is only to the Union.
    *   No separate state citizenship.
    *   Contrast with USA and Australia, which have dual citizenship (national and state).

    *   Parliament can prescribe residence as a condition for certain state/UT employments (Article 16).
    *   States can provide special benefits to residents in matters not covered by constitutional rights (e.g., education fee concessions).
