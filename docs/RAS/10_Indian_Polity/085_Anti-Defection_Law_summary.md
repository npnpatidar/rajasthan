# Anti-Defection Law

*   The 52nd Amendment Act of 1985 introduced the disqualification of members of Parliament and state legislatures on the ground of defection.
    *   It made changes in Articles 101, 102, 190, and 191 of the Constitution.
    *   It added the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution, often called the 'anti-defection law'.
*   The 91st Amendment Act of 2003 modified the Tenth Schedule by removing the exception for disqualification in the case of a split.

## Provisions of the Act (Tenth Schedule)

*   **Disqualification:**
    *   **Members of Political Parties:** A member is disqualified:
        *   If he/she voluntarily gives up membership of the political party.
        *   If he/she votes or abstains against party direction without prior permission, and the act is not condoned within 15 days.
    *   **Independent Members:** Disqualified if joining any political party after election.
    *   **Nominated Members:** Disqualified if joining any political party after six months from taking their seat.

*   **Exceptions:** Disqualification does not apply:
    *   In case of a merger of the party with another party, if two-thirds of the members have agreed to the merger.
    *   If a member, after being elected as the presiding officer of the House, voluntarily gives up party membership or rejoins after ceasing to hold that office.

*   The 91st Amendment Act of 2003 deleted the provision pertaining to exemption from disqualification in case of split by one-third members of the legislature party.

## Deciding Authority

*   The presiding officer of the House decides on disqualification arising from defection.
*   Originally, the presiding officer's decision was final and not subject to judicial review.
*   The Supreme Court, in Kihoto Hollohan case (1992), declared this provision unconstitutional.
*   The presiding officer functions as a tribunal and is subject to judicial review on grounds of mala fides, perversity, etc.

## Rule-Making Power

*   The presiding officer can make rules to give effect to the provisions of the Tenth Schedule.
*   Rules must be placed before the House for 30 days and can be approved, modified, or disapproved.
*   The presiding officer can take up a defection case only upon receiving a complaint.
*   The member against whom the complaint is made must be given a chance to submit their explanation.

## Evaluation of the Act

*   Aims to prevent defections motivated by the lure of office or material benefits.
*   Intended to strengthen Indian parliamentary democracy by curbing unethical defections.

## Advantages

*   Provides greater stability by checking the propensity of legislators to change parties.
*   Facilitates democratic realignment of parties through mergers.
*   Reduces corruption and non-developmental expenditure on irregular elections.

## Criticism

*   Does not differentiate between dissent and defection, curbing the legislator's right to freedom of conscience.
*   Distinction between individual and group defection is irrational.
*   Does not provide for expulsion for activities outside the legislature.
*   Discrimination between independent and nominated members is illogical.
*   Vesting decision-making authority in the presiding officer is criticized due to potential political bias and lack of legal knowledge.
