*   No uniformity in the organization of state legislatures.
*   **Unicameral:** Most states (22) have only a Legislative Assembly and the Governor.

*   Parliament's Act to create/abolish is not a constitutional amendment and is passed by simple majority.

#### Ordinary Bills
*   Originating House: Can originate in either House (bicameral legislature). Introduced by a minister or any member. Passes through three stages: first reading, second reading, and third reading.
*   Second House: Transmitted to the other House for consideration and passage. Bill deemed passed only when both Houses agree. In unicameral legislatures, a bill is sent directly to the governor after passage in the assembly.
*   The bill passes through all the three stages.

#### Legislative Assembly vs. Legislative Council for Bill Passage
*   If the legislative assembly sends a bill to the legislative council, the legislative council has 4 alternatives:
1.  it may pass the bill as sent by the assembly (i.e., without amendments);
2.  it may pass the bill with amendments and return it to the assembly for reconsideration;
3.  it may reject the bill altogether; and
4.  it may not take any action and thus keep the bill pending.
*   If the council passes the bill without amendments or the assembly accepts the amendments suggested by the council, the bill is deemed to have been passed by both the Houses and the same is sent to the the governor for his/her assent.
*   If the assembly rejects the amendments suggested by the council or the council rejects the bill altogether or the council does not take any action for three months, then the assembly may pass the bill again and transmit the same to the council.
*   If the council rejects the bill again or passes the bill with amendments not acceptable to the assembly or does not pass the bill within one month, then the bill is deemed to have been passed by both the Houses in the form in which it was passed by the assembly for the second time.
*   The ultimate power of passing an ordinary bill is vested in the assembly.
*   Constitution does not provide for the mechanism of joint sitting of both the Houses to resolve the disagreement between the two Houses over a bill.
*   When a bill, which has originated in the council and was sent to the assembly, is rejected by the assembly, the bill ends and becomes dead.
*   The council has much lesser significance, position and authority than that of the Rajya Sabha at the Centre.

#### Assent of the Governor
*   After passage in the assembly or both houses, presented to the governor for assent.
*   Four alternatives:
    *   Give assent
    *   Withhold assent (bill ends)
    *   Return for reconsideration (suspensive veto)
    *   Reserve for the President's consideration
*   If returned, and the bill is passed again with or without amendments, the governor must give assent.

#### Assent of the President
*   When a bill is reserved by the governor for the consideration of the President, the President may either give his/her assent to the bill or withhold his/her assent to the bill or return the bill for reconsideration of the House or Houses of the state legislature.
*   Not mentioned in the Constitution whether it is obligatory on the part of the president to give his/her assent to such a bill or not.

#### Money Bills
*   Special procedure outlined in Constitution.
*   Cannot be introduced in the legislative council; can be introduced in the legislative assembly only with governor's recommendation.
