*   **Second Administrative Reforms Commission Recommendations on GoMs**

    1.  Constitution of a large number of GoMs has resulted in many GoMs not being able to meet regularly to complete their work thus leading to significant delays on many major issues.
    2.  More selective use of GoMs would lead to more effective coordination, especially if empowered to decide on behalf of Cabinet with time limits.
    3.  Need to ensure existing coordination mechanisms of GoMs function effectively for early resolution of issues with clear mandate and prescribed time limits.
