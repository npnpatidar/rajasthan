# Scheduled and Tribal Areas

### Article 244
*   Part X of the Constitution provides a special system of administration for 'scheduled areas' and 'tribal areas'.
*   Fifth Schedule: Administration and control of scheduled areas and tribes in any state except Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.
*   Sixth Schedule: Administration of tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.

## Administration of Scheduled Areas

*   Scheduled areas are treated differently due to the presence of socially and economically backward 'aboriginals'.
*   Special efforts are needed to improve their condition.
*   Normal administrative machinery is not fully extended to scheduled areas.
*   The Central government has greater responsibility for these areas.
*   Currently, ten states in India have scheduled areas: Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, and Rajasthan.

### Features of Administration (Fifth Schedule):

1.  **Declaration of Scheduled Areas:**
    *   The President can declare an area as a scheduled area, increase/decrease its area, alter boundaries, or rescind/redesignate areas, after consulting with the Governor.
    *   Criteria for declaration (not explicitly in the Constitution, but well-established):
        *   Preponderance of tribal population.
        *   Compactness and reasonable size.
        *   Viable administrative entity (District, Block, Taluk).
        *   Economic backwardness compared to neighboring areas.

2.  **Executive Power of State and Centre:**
    *   State's executive power extends to scheduled areas.
    *   Governor has special responsibility and must submit a report to the President annually or when required.

3.  **Tribes Advisory Council:**
    *   Each state with scheduled areas must establish a Tribes Advisory Council.
    *   Consists of 20 members, with 3/4ths being representatives of scheduled tribes in the state legislative assembly.
    *   A similar council can be established in states with scheduled tribes but no scheduled areas if directed by the President.

4.  **Law Applicable to Scheduled Areas:**
    *   The Governor can direct that any act of Parliament or the state legislature does not apply or applies with modifications/exceptions to a scheduled area.
    *   The Governor can make regulations for peace and good government after consulting the Tribes Advisory Council.
    *   Such regulations may:
        *   Prohibit or restrict land transfer among scheduled tribes.
        *   Regulate land allotment to scheduled tribes.
        *   Regulate money-lending in relation to scheduled tribes.
    *   Regulations may repeal or amend any act of Parliament or state legislature applicable to a scheduled area.
    *   All regulations require the President's assent.

*   The Constitution mandates the President to appoint a commission to report on the administration of scheduled areas and the welfare of scheduled tribes.
*   Such a commission can be appointed anytime, but compulsorily after ten years from the Constitution's commencement.
*   A commission was appointed in 1960 (headed by U.N. Dhebar; report in 1961).
*   The second commission was appointed in 2002 (headed by Dilip Singh Bhuria; report in 2004).

## Administration of Tribal Areas (Sixth Schedule)

*   Special provisions exist for the administration of tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.
*   Rationality: Tribes in these states have not assimilated with other populations and maintain their unique culture, customs, and civilization.

### Key Features of the Sixth Schedule:

1.  **Autonomous Districts:** Tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram are constituted as autonomous districts but remain under the state's executive authority.
2.  **Governor's Power:** The Governor can organize and reorganize the autonomous districts, including altering areas, names, and boundaries.
3.  **Autonomous Regions:** If there are different tribes in an autonomous district, the Governor can divide the district into several autonomous regions.
4.  **District Councils:** Each autonomous district has a district council of 30 members (4 nominated by the Governor, 26 elected by adult franchise). Elected members serve for five years.  Each autonomous region also has a separate regional council.
5.  **Council Powers:** District and regional councils administer their areas and can make laws on land, forests, canal water, shifting cultivation, village administration, inheritance, marriage, social customs, etc., subject to the Governor's assent.
6.  **Village Councils and Courts:** District and regional councils can constitute village councils/courts for trials between tribes and hear appeals. The High Court's jurisdiction is specified by the Governor.
7.  **Developmental Powers:** The district council can establish/manage primary schools, dispensaries, markets, ferries, fisheries, roads, etc., and regulate money lending/trading by non-tribals (with the Governor's assent).
8.  **Financial Powers:** District and regional councils can assess/collect land revenue and impose specified taxes.
9.  **Applicability of Laws:** Acts of Parliament or the State Legislature may not apply or may apply with specified modifications/exceptions to autonomous districts and regions.
10. **Commission and Dissolution:** The Governor can appoint a commission to examine and report on the administration of autonomous districts/regions and may dissolve a district/regional council based on the commission's recommendation.
