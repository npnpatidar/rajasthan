#### First-Past-The-Post System

*   Constitution adopts this system for Lok Sabha elections.
*   Every member represents a geographical area (constituency).
*   Single-member constituencies; candidate with a majority of votes is elected.
*   This system does not represent the whole electorate or secure due representation to minorities.
*   Proportional representation aims at removing the defects of territorial representation.

    <br>
*Two kinds of proportional representation:
    *   Single Transferable Vote System
    *   List System

    <br>
*   India uses single transferable vote for Rajya Sabha, state legislative councils, President, and Vice-President.
*   Constitution has not adopted the proportional representation for election of members to the Lok Sabha due to the following two reasons:
    1.  Difficulty for the voters to understand the system (which is complicated) due to low literacy scale in the country.
    2. Unsuitability to the parliamentary government due to the tendency of the system to multiply political parties leading to instability in government.
*   Demerits of proportional representation:
    1.  Highly expensive
    2.  No scope for by-elections
    3.  Eliminates intimate contacts
    4.  Promotes minority thinking
    5.  Increases the significance of the party system
