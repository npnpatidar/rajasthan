### Emergence of the Basic Structure
*   The question of whether Fundamental Rights could be amended under Article 368 was raised shortly after the Constitution's enactment.
*   **Shankari Prasad Case (1951):** The Supreme Court ruled that the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution under Article 368 included the power to amend Fundamental Rights. The word 'law' in Article 13 was interpreted to exclude constitutional amendment acts, allowing Parliament to abridge or remove Fundamental Rights via constitutional amendments.
*   **Sajjan Singh Case (1964):** The Supreme Court reaffirmed its stance from the Shankari Prasad case, holding that constitutional amendment acts under Article 368 are not 'law' within the meaning of Article 13.
*   **Golak Nath Case (1967):** The Supreme Court reversed its previous stance, ruling that Fundamental Rights hold a 'transcendental and immutable' position and cannot be abridged or taken away by Parliament. Constitutional amendment acts were deemed 'law' under Article 13, thus void if violating Fundamental Rights.
*   **24th Amendment Act (1971):** Enacted in response to the Golak Nath case, this act amended Articles 13 and 368, declaring Parliament's power to abridge or remove Fundamental Rights under Article 368, with such acts not considered 'law' under Article 13.
*   **Kesavananda Bharati Case (1973):** The Supreme Court overruled the Golak Nath case but upheld the validity of the 24th Amendment Act. It introduced the 'basic structure' doctrine, stating that Parliament's constituent power under Article 368 does not allow it to alter the 'basic structure' of the Constitution.
*   **Indira Nehru Gandhi Case (1975):** The Supreme Court reaffirmed and applied the basic structure doctrine, invalidating a provision of the 39th Amendment Act (1975) that removed election disputes involving the Prime Minister and Speaker of Lok Sabha from court jurisdiction, as it affected the basic structure.
*   **42nd Amendment Act (1976):** Parliament attempted to negate the basic structure doctrine by amending Article 368 to declare unlimited constituent power, preventing challenges to amendments in any court.
*   **Minerva Mills Case (1980):** The Supreme Court invalidated the amendment introduced by the 42nd Amendment Act. It upheld the 'basic structure' doctrine with respect to Article 368, stating that the limited amending power is a basic feature of the Constitution.
*   **Waman Rao Case (1980):** The Supreme Court affirmed the doctrine of basic structure and clarified that it would apply to constitutional amendments enacted after April 24, 1973 (date of Kesavananda Bharati Judgement).

### Elements of the Basic Structure
*   The Parliament can amend any part of the Constitution, including Fundamental Rights, under Article 368, but cannot affect the 'basic structure.'
*   The Supreme Court has not definitively clarified what constitutes the 'basic structure,' but various judgements have identified elements:
    1.  Supremacy of the Constitution
    2.  Sovereign, democratic and republican nature of the Indian polity
    3.  Secular character of the Constitution
    4.  Separation of powers between the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary
    5.  Federal character of the Constitution
    6.  Unity and integrity of the nation
    7.  Welfare state (socio-economic justice)
    8.  Judicial review
    9.  Freedom and dignity of the individual
    10. Parliamentary system
    11. Rule of law
    12. Harmony and balance between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles
    13. Principle of equality
    14. Free and fair elections
    15. Independence of Judiciary
    16. Limited power of Parliament to amend the Constitution
    17. Effective access to justice
    18. Principles (or essence) underlying fundamental rights
    19. Powers of the Supreme Court under Articles 32, 136, 141 and 142
    20. Powers of the High Courts under Articles 226 and 227
