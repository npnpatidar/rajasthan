*   **Supreme Court Observations (December 2007):**
    *   Called for judicial restraint.
    *   Courts should not take over the functions of the legislature or executive.
    *   Each organ of the state must respect the others' domain.
    *   Judges cannot cross their limits in the name of activism.
    *   Judges must know their limits and not try to run the government.
    *   Judicial restraint is consistent with the balance of power among the three independent branches of the state.
    *   Quoting Montesquieu, warned against the consequences of not maintaining separation of powers.
    *   If the legislature or executive are not functioning properly it is for the people to correct the defects by voting and elections.
    *   Judicial restraint recognizes the equality of the other two branches of the state and minimizes inter-branch interference.
    *   When courts encroach on the legislative or administrative fields elected officials will conclude that the activities of judges should be closely monitored.
