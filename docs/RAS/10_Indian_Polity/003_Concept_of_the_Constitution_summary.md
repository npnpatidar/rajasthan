### Classification of Constitutions

1.  **Evolved vs. Enacted:**
    *   **Evolved:** Gradual, based on conventions, practices, principles, and judicial decisions (e.g., British Constitution).
    *   **Enacted:** Deliberately created by a constituent assembly or similar body, in a formal document (e.g., American and Indian Constitutions).
2.  **Written vs. Unwritten:**
    *   **Written:** Provisions in a formal document or series of documents, consciously formulated (e.g., USA, Canada, Japan, France and India).
    *   **Unwritten:** Primarily based on conventions, practices, principles, charters, statutes, and judicial decisions; product of historical evolution (e.g., UK, New Zealand, Israel).
3.  **Rigid vs. Flexible:**
    *   **Rigid:** Requires a special procedure for amendment, distinguishing constitutional law from ordinary law (e.g., USA, Australia, Switzerland).
    *   **Flexible:** Amended in the same manner as ordinary laws, without a special procedure (e.g., UK, New Zealand).
    *   **Indian Constitution:** A synthesis of both rigid and flexible.
4.  **Federal vs. Unitary:**
    *   **Federal:** Divides power between national and regional governments, enabling independent operation in respective jurisdictions (e.g., USA, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, Russia, Brazil).

5.  **Procedural vs. Prescriptive**
    *   **Procedural:** Defines the legal and political structures of public institutions and sets out the legal limits of government power to protect democratic processes and fundamental human rights.
    *   **Prescriptive:** In addition to describing how the government functions, a prescriptive constitution assumes a broad consensus on common societal goals that public authorities must strive to achieve.
