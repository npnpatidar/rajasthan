### Supreme Court

*   The Indian Constitution establishes an integrated judicial system, with the Supreme Court at the top and high courts below.

*   The Supreme Court was inaugurated on January 28, 1950, succeeding the Federal Court of India (established under the Government of India Act of 1935).

*   Articles 124 to 147 in Part V of the Constitution deal with the Supreme Court's organization, independence, jurisdiction, powers, and procedures.

### Composition and Appointment

*   The Supreme Court currently consists of thirty-four judges (one chief justice and thirty-three other judges).
*   Originally, the Supreme Court had eight judges (one chief justice and seven other judges).

    | Year | Judges |
    | :--- | :----- |
    | 1956 | Ten    |
    | 1960 | Thirteen |
    | 1977 | Seventeen |
    | 1986 | Twenty-five |
    | 2008 | Thirty     |
    | 2019 | Thirty-three |

*   Judges are appointed by the President. The chief justice is appointed after consultation with Supreme Court and high court judges. Other judges are appointed after consultation with the chief justice and other judges.

*   The Supreme Court has given different interpretations of the word 'consultation':

    *   **First Judges Case (1981):** Consultation does not mean concurrence.
    *   **Second Judges Case (1993):** Consultation means concurrence; the advice of the Chief Justice of India is binding, after consulting two seniormost colleagues.
    *   **Third Judges Case (1998):** Consultation requires 'consultation of plurality judges'; the Chief Justice must consult a collegium of four seniormost judges.

*   **99th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2014:** It was introduced with the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act of 2014 to replace the collegium system. In 2015, the Supreme Court declared both as unconstitutional, reinstating the collegium system.

*   From 1950 to 1973, the seniormost judge was appointed as Chief Justice of India. This convention was violated in 1973 and 1977. The Second Judges Case (1993) curtailed this discretion, ruling the seniormost judge should be appointed.
