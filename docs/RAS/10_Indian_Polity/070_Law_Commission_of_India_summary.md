#### Historical Background

*   During British rule, four Law Commissions were established in the 19th century.

*   Examples include:
    *   The Indian Penal Code
    *   Criminal Procedure Code
    *   Civil Procedure Code
    *   Indian Contract Act
    *   Indian Evidence Act

#### Commissions Constituted So Far

*   Post-Independence, the Constitution of India with Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy, influenced law reform.
*   Article 372 states pre-Constitution laws remain in force until amended or repealed.
*   Demands arose for a new Law Commission to revise outdated laws.
*   The First Law Commission of independent India was established in 1955, headed by MC Setalvad. Its term was three years.
*   Since 1955, twenty-one more Law Commissions have been constituted, each with a three-year term and with different terms of reference.
