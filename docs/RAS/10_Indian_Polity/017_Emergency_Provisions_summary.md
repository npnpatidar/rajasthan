*   Enable the Central government to meet abnormal situations effectively.
*   Safeguard sovereignty, unity, integrity, security, democratic political system, and the Constitution.

### Three Types of Emergencies:

1.  **National Emergency (Article 352)**:

    *   Due to war, external aggression, or armed rebellion.
    *   Referred to as 'proclamation of emergency'.
2.  **State Emergency/President's Rule (Article 356)**:

    *   Due to failure of constitutional machinery in states.
    *   Also known as 'State Emergency' or 'Constitutional Emergency'.
3.  **Financial Emergency (Article 360)**:

    *   Due to threat to the financial stability or credit of India.

## National Emergency

### Grounds of Declaration

*   President can declare when the security of India (or a part) is threatened by war, external aggression, or armed rebellion.
*   Can be declared even before actual occurrence if imminent danger exists.
*   'Armed rebellion' replaced 'internal disturbance' via the 44th Amendment Act of 1978.
*   President requires a written recommendation from the cabinet to proclaim a National Emergency.
*   The 38th Amendment Act of 1975 made the declaration immune to judicial review.
*   Immunity to judicial review was deleted by the 44th Amendment Act of 1978.
*   Supreme Court held in *Minerva Mills* case (1980): proclamation can be challenged if based on malafide, extraneous/irrelevant facts, or is absurd/perverse.

### Parliamentary Approval and Duration

*   Must be approved by both Houses of Parliament within one month of issue.
*   Originally two months, reduced by the 44th Amendment Act of 1978.
*   If Lok Sabha is dissolved, proclamation survives until 30 days from first sitting after reconstitution, provided Rajya Sabha approves.
*   Emergency continues for six months if approved by Parliament; extendable to an indefinite period with approval every six months (44th Amendment Act).
*   Special majority required for approval:

    *   Majority of total membership of each house.
    *   Majority of not less than two-thirds of members present and voting.

### Revocation of Proclamation

*   President can revoke by subsequent proclamation (no parliamentary approval needed).
*   President *must* revoke if Lok Sabha passes a resolution disapproving continuation (44th Amendment Act).
*   If 1/10th of Lok Sabha members give written notice to Speaker (or President if not in session), a special sitting must be held within 14 days to consider disapproval resolution.
*   Difference between disapproval and approval resolutions:
    *   Disapproval: Lok Sabha only, simple majority.
    *   Approval: Both Houses, special majority.

### Effects of National Emergency

Drastic and wide-ranging effects, grouped into three categories:

1.  **Effect on Centre-State Relations:**

    *   Executive: Centre can direct any state on how to exercise executive power (normally limited).
    *   Legislative: Parliament can make laws on any subject in State List; state legislature's power becomes subject to Parliament (Constitution becomes unitary). Laws become inoperative six months after emergency ceases. The President can issue ordinances on state subjects if Parliament is not in session.
    *   Financial: President can modify the constitutional distribution of revenues between Centre and states; order must be laid before both Houses.
2.  **Effect on the Life of the Lok Sabha and State Assembly:**

    *   Lok Sabha's life can be extended by law of Parliament for one year at a time (any length of time), subject to a maximum period of six months after the emergency ceases.
    *   The Parliament may extend the normal tenure of a state legislative assembly.
3.  **Effect on Fundamental Rights:**

    *   Articles 358 and 359 describe the effect.
    *   **Article 358**: Suspension of Article 19:
        *   The six Fundamental Rights under Article 19 are automatically suspended.
        *   The state can make any law or take any executive action abridging or taking away the six Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Article 19.
        *   No challenge on the ground of inconsistency with Article 19.
        *   Article 19 automatically revives when the National Emergency ceases.
        *   The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 restricted the scope of Article 358 in two ways.
        *   Article 19 stands suspended only when the National Emergency is declared on the ground of war or external aggression and not on the ground of armed rebellion.
        *   Only those laws which are related with the Emergency are protected from being challenged and not other laws.
    *   **Article 359**: Suspension of other Fundamental Rights:
        *   President can suspend the right to move any court for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights during an Emergency.
        *   The said rights are theoretically alive but the right to seek remedy is suspended.
        *   Relates only to those Fundamental Rights that are specified in the Presidential Order.
        *   The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 restricted the scope of Article 359 in two ways.
