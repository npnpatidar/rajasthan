This necessitates devolution of powers to the Chairperson of the commission in administrative as well as financial matters.
*   Financial Constraints
    *   The commission wishes to have financial autonomy to purchase vehicles as the same has not been delegated.
*   Manpower Constraints
    *   Since its inception, the commission has never had the full sanctioned strength as compared to the available strength.
