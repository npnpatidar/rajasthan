# Tribunals

### Introduction
*   The original Constitution did not contain provisions for tribunals.
*   Part XIV-A was added by the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976.
*   This part is titled "Tribunals" and consists of two Articles:
    *   Article 323A: Deals with administrative tribunals.
    *   Article 323B: Deals with tribunals for other matters.

*   Parliament passed the Administrative Tribunals Act in 1985.
*   The act authorizes the Central government to establish:
    *   Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT)
    *   State Administrative Tribunals
