### Duties and Powers
*   The Constitution (Article 149) authorizes Parliament to prescribe the CAG's duties and powers.
*   Parliament enacted the CAG's (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971.
*   Duties and Functions:
    1.  Audits accounts related to all expenditures from the Consolidated Fund of India/State/Union territory.
    2.  Audits transactions related to Contingency Funds and Public Accounts.
    3.  Audits trading, manufacturing, profit and loss accounts, balance sheets, etc., of government departments.

*   Powers related to Audit Duties:
    *   Inspect any office/department subject to audit.
    *   Examine transactions and question the person in charge.
    *   Call for records, papers, and documents from any audited entity.
    *   Decide the extent and manner of audit.

### Role
*   Uphold the Constitution and laws of Parliament in financial administration.
*   Secure accountability of the executive to the Parliament through audit reports.
*   Submits three audit reports to the President:
    *   Audit report on appropriation accounts
    *   Audit report on finance accounts
    *   Audit report on public undertakings
*   The President lays these reports before both Houses of Parliament. The Public Accounts Committee examines the reports.
*   The CAG ascertains whether disbursed moneys were legally available and applicable and whether the expenditure conforms to the governing authority.
*   Conducts both regulatory and propriety audits. Propriety audit, unlike regulatory audit, is discretionary and examines the 'wisdom, faithfulness and economy' of government expenditure.
*   Conducts performance audits that cover economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the receipt and application of public funds.
*   More freedom in auditing expenditure than receipts, stores and stock. The CAG decides the scope of expenditure audit and frames their own codes, but must get executive approval for rules on other audits.
*   Limitations on auditing secret service expenditure: the CAG cannot call for particulars but must accept a certificate from the competent authority.

### CAG and Corporations
*   The role of the CAG in auditing public corporations is limited.
*   Categorization:
    *   Some corporations are audited totally and directly by the CAG.
    *   Some are audited by private professional auditors appointed by the Central Government in consultation with the CAG.
    *   Some are entirely subjected to private audit.
*   Government companies are audited by private auditors appointed by the Government on the advise of the CAG. The CAG can also undertake supplementary or test audit.

### Appleby's Criticism
*   Paul H Appleby criticized the CAG's role and significance:
    1.  The function of the CAG in India is an inheritance from the colonial rule.
    2.  The CAG is a primary cause of unwillingness to act, and auditing has a repressive influence.
    3.  Parliament exaggerates the importance of auditing.
    4.  The CAG's function is not very important; auditors do not know much about good administration.
    5.  Auditing is a necessary but pedestrian function.
    6.  A deputy secretary knows more about departmental problems than the CAG.

### Challenges

*   The Second Administrative Reforms Commission identified challenges:
    *   Limited detailed examination of audit paras by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).
    *   Action Taken Notes by Ministries/Departments are largely formal.
    *   Huge pendency of audit paras in State Legislatures.
    *   Thousands of unattended inspection reports.
    *   CAG's reports sometimes are not timely.
    *   Audit findings are based exclusively on documents, not ground reality.
    *   External audit reports tend to be unduly negative.
    *   Audit often does not discriminate between bona fide/malafide intentions.
    *   Audit Reports are not always presented in a constructive manner.
    *   Reporting already known problems does not add value.
    *   Findings are at times not focused.
    *   Audit does not give due credit for good performance.
    *   The relationship between the auditor and auditee is not always harmonious.
    *   Audit is viewed as a system for policing Government Organizations.
    *   Though Audit Committees have been set up, their functioning is not satisfactory.
    *   There is a lack of informed media coverage of CAG's reports.
    *   There is inadequate synergy/coordination between external audit and internal audit.
    *   External audit does not provide audit assurance on the fair presentation of financial statements of the Government.
    *   There is rarely any audit of grants and loans to NGOs.
