### Lokpal and Lokayuktas

#### Global Scenario
*   Modern democratic states are characterized by a welfare orientation, leading to an increased role of government in socio-economic development.
*   This expansion increases administrative power and discretion of civil servants, creating opportunities for abuse, harassment, malpractices, maladministration, and corruption.
*   The success of democracy depends on addressing citizens' grievances.

**Institutional Devices for Redressal of Grievances:**

1.  The Ombudsman System
2.  The Administrative Courts System
3.  The Procurator System

**The Ombudsman System:**

*   The earliest democratic institution for addressing citizens' grievances originated in Scandinavia.
*   Donald C. Rowat describes it as uniquely appropriate for dealing with citizens' complaints about unfair administrative actions.
*   First created in Sweden in 1809; 'Ombud' refers to a representative or spokesman.

**Swedish Ombudsman:**

*   Deals with citizens' grievances in the following matters:
    *   Abuse of administrative discretion
    *   Maladministration
    *   Administrative corruption
    *   Nepotism
    *   Discourtesy

*   The Ombudsman is a constitutional authority with powers to supervise compliance with laws and regulations by public officials.
*   The authority has no power to reverse decisions or directly control administration or the courts.
*   The Ombudsman can act on complaints or suo moto (on his/her own initiative).
*   Can prosecute erring officials, including judges, but cannot inflict punishment; only reports to higher authorities.
*   From Sweden, the institution spread to other Scandinavian countries and New Zealand.

**Other Systems:**

*   The United Kingdom adopted a similar institution called Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration.
*   Ombudsman-like institutions exist worldwide under different names. In India it is known as Lokpal/Lokayukta.
*   Donald C. Rowat describes the Ombudsman as a bulwark of democratic government against the tyranny of officialdom.
*   Gerald E. Caiden describes the Ombudsman as an institutionalized public conscience.
*   The French system of Administrative Courts is another device for redressal of citizens' grievances.
*   Socialist countries (former USSR, China) have the Procurator System.

#### Position in India

*   The existing legal and institutional framework to check corruption and redress citizens' grievances in India consists of the following:

#### Lokpal

*   The First Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC) (1966-1970) recommended establishing 'Lokpal' and 'lokayukta' for citizens' grievance redressal.
*   Modeled after the Ombudsman in Scandinavian countries and the parliamentary commissioner in New Zealand.
*   The Lokpal would handle complaints against ministers and secretaries at Central and state levels.
*   The lokayukta would handle complaints against other higher officials.
*   The judiciary was kept outside the purview of Lokpal and lokayukta.
*   The ARC recommended the Lokpal be appointed by the President after consulting with the Chief Justice of India, the Speaker of Lok Sabha, and the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha.

**Recommended features of Lokpal and lokayukta:**

1.  Independent and impartial
2.  Private and informal investigations
3.  Non-political appointments
4.  Status comparable to highest judicial functionaries
5.  Deals with injustice, corruption, or favoritism
6.  Proceedings not subject to judicial interference
7.  Maximum latitude and powers in obtaining relevant information
8.  No benefit from the executive government

*   The Government of India accepted the ARC recommendations.
*   Ten official attempts were made to introduce legislation on this subject.
*   The Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act was finally enacted in 2013.
