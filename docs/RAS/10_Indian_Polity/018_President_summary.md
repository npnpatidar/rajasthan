## President

### Union Executive

*   Articles 52 to 78 in Part V of the Constitution deal with the Union executive.
*   The Union executive consists of:
    *   The President
    *   The Vice-President
    *   The Prime Minister
    *   The council of ministers
    *   The attorney general of India
*   The President is the head of the Indian State, the first citizen, and the symbol of unity, integrity, and solidarity of the nation.

### Election of the President

*   Elected indirectly by an electoral college consisting of:
    *   Elected members of both Houses of Parliament.
    *   Elected members of the legislative assemblies of the states.
    *   Elected members of the legislative assemblies of the Union Territories of Delhi and Puducherry.
*   The following do *not* participate in the Presidential election:
    *   Nominated members of Parliament.
    *   Nominated members of state legislative assemblies.
    *   Members (both elected and nominated) of state legislative councils.
    *   Nominated members of the Legislative Assemblies of Delhi and Puducherry.
*   The 104th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2019 discontinued the nomination of Anglo-Indian members to the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies. This provision ceased to have effect on January 25th, 2020.
*   If an assembly is dissolved, its members cannot vote, even if fresh elections are not held before the presidential election.
*   The Constitution ensures uniformity in the scale of representation of different states and parity between the states as a whole and the Union.
*   **Value of Vote Calculation:**

    *   **MLA:**
        ```
        Value = (Population of State / Total Elected Members in Assembly) * (1/1000)
        ```
    *   **MP:**

        ```
        Value = (Total Value of Votes of all MLAs of all States) / (Total Number of Elected Members of Parliament)
        ```
*   Election is held via proportional representation by single transferable vote, with secret ballot.
*   To be elected, a candidate must secure a fixed quota of votes:
    ```
    Electoral quota = (Total number of valid votes polled / (1+1)) + 1
    ```
*   Voters mark preferences (1, 2, 3, etc.) on the ballot.
*   First preference votes are counted. If no candidate reaches the required quota, the candidate with the fewest first preference votes is eliminated, and their votes are transferred based on second preferences, and so on, until a candidate secures the required quota.
*   The Supreme Court handles all election-related disputes, and its decision is final.
*   Presidential election cannot be challenged on the grounds of an incomplete electoral college.
*   Acts done by a President before the Supreme Court declares their election void remain valid.
*   The indirect election was chosen for these reasons:
    *   Harmony with the parliamentary system (President is a nominal executive).
    *   Direct election would be too costly, time-consuming, and energy-consuming.
    *   A directly elected president would have more power than desired.

### Veto Power of the President

*   The President has the veto power over the bills passed by the Parliament, that is, he/she can withhold his/her assent to the bills.
*   **Types of Veto:**
    *   Absolute Veto
    *   Suspensive Veto
    *   Pocket Veto
*   **Absolute Veto:**
    *   Withholding assent to a bill.  The bill does not become law.
    *   Exercised with private member's bills or government bills when the cabinet resigns.
*   **Suspensive Veto:**
    *   Returning a bill for reconsideration.
    *   If the bill is passed again by Parliament with or without amendments, the President *must* give assent.
    *   Cannot be used for Money Bills.
*   **Pocket Veto:**
    *   Neither ratifying nor rejecting the bill, keeping it pending indefinitely.
    *   The Indian President's "pocket" is considered bigger than the American President's because the Constitution does not prescribe any time limit to act on bills.
*   President has no veto power over constitutional amendment bills. The 24th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1971 made it obligatory for the President to give his assent to a constitutional amendment bill.
*   President also has veto power over state legislation. If a state bill is reserved by the governor, the President can:
    *   Give assent
    *   Withhold assent
    *   Direct the governor to return the bill.
    *   However, the President is *not* bound to give assent even if the state legislature passes the bill again. Therefore the pocket veto can be used.

### Ordinance-Making Power of the President

*   Article 123 empowers the President to promulgate ordinances during the recess of Parliament.
*   Ordinances have the same force and effect as an act of Parliament but are temporary laws.
*   Limitations:
    *   Can only promulgate when both Houses are not in session, or when either House is not in session.
    *   Can only make an ordinance when satisfied that circumstances exist that render immediate action necessary.  The Cooper case (1970) established that the Supreme Court can question this satisfaction.
    *   Ordinance-making power is coextensive with Parliament's law-making power (except for duration).
    *   Ordinance can be issued only on subjects on which Parliament can make laws.
    *   Ordinance is subject to the same constitutional limitations as an act of Parliament.
    *   Ordinances must be laid before both Houses when Parliament reassembles and will cease to operate in six weeks, in case of non-approval by the Parliament.
*   The President can also withdraw an ordinance at any time, however this can only be done with the advice of the council of ministers headed by the Prime Minister.
*   Ordinances can be retrospective.
*   Rules of Lok Sabha require a statement explaining the need for immediate legislation by ordinance when a bill seeking to replace an ordinance is introduced.

### Pardoning Power of the President

*   Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons.
*   Applies in cases where:
    *   Punishment is for an offence against a Union Law.
    *   Punishment is by a court martial.
    *   Sentence is a sentence of death.
*   The President's pardoning power is independent of the judiciary.
*   Purposes:
    *   To correct judicial errors.
    *   To afford relief from unduly harsh sentences.
*   **Includes:**
    *   Pardon: Removes sentence, conviction, and disqualifications.
    *   Commutation: Substitutes a lighter form of punishment.
    *   Remission: Reduces the period of the sentence without changing its character.
    *   Respite: Awards a lesser sentence due to a special fact.
    *   Reprieve: Stays the execution of a sentence temporarily.
*   The Governor of a state also has pardoning power (Article 161), but the President's power differs in that:
    *   The President can pardon sentences inflicted by court martial, while the governor cannot.
    *   The President can pardon death sentences, while the governor cannot (the governor can only suspend, remit or commute a death sentence).

### Constitutional Position of the President

*   India has a parliamentary form of government. The President is a nominal executive who must act on the aid and advice of the council of ministers headed by the Prime Minister.
*   Dr. B.R. Ambedkar emphasized that the President of India occupies a position similar to the King under the English Constitution.
*   The 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act made the President bound by the advice of the council of ministers.
*   The 44th Amendment authorized the President to require reconsideration of the advice, but the reconsidered advice is binding.
*   The President has some *situational discretion*:
    *   Appointment of Prime Minister when no party has a clear majority.
    *   Dismissal of the council of ministers that cannot prove confidence.
    *   Dissolution of the Lok Sabha if the council of ministers has lost its majority.
