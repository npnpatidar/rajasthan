    *   **Equity:** Resources should be distributed justly and fairly.  Government must give special attention to deprived sections.
    *   **Human Rights:** Everyone has the right to live with dignity.  No one should be deprived of human rights (Article 19, Article 21).
    *   **Participation:** Ensure participation of all in social decision-making.  Everyone should get appropriate representation ( Democracy)
    *   **Diversity:** Diverse groups in society must be respected; there should be no discrimination.

*   **Objective:** To create an egalitarian society where everyone gets equal opportunity and deprived sections get special protection (women, children, the elderly, backward classes, etc.).

*   **Types of Justice:**

    *   **Procedural Justice:** Associated with process, rules and laws. If these are just then society will be just.
    *   **Substantive Justice:** Focused on outcomes. Justice can only be ensured by making changes in outcomes and circumstances. Social justice is related to this.
