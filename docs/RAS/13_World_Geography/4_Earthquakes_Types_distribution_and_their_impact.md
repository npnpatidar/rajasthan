---

## 🧾 **1. Definition and Causes**

- An **earthquake** is the **shaking of the Earth** caused by the **release of energy** in the Earth's crust.
    
- The energy release generates **seismic waves** that travel in all directions.
    
- Most earthquakes occur **along faults** due to **tectonic movements**.
    

### 🔄 **Causes of Earthquakes**

|**Cause**|**Details**|
|---|---|
|**Tectonic movement**|Sudden slip along faults due to crustal stress.|
|**Volcanic activity**|During violent eruptions, e.g., in volcanic regions (volcanic earthquakes).|
|**Collapse of underground mines**|Called collapse earthquakes.|
|**Explosion earthquakes**|Result from nuclear or chemical explosions.|
|**Reservoir-induced earthquakes**|Large man-made reservoirs create pressure changes in Earth's crust.|
|**Folding, faulting**|Movement or displacement in rock strata.|

## 📍 **2. Focus and Epicentre**

|**Term**|**Definition**|
|---|---|
|**Focus / Hypocentre**|Point inside the Earth where energy is released (origin of quake). Usually ≤60 km deep.|
|**Epicentre**|Point on Earth's surface directly above the focus. Most severe shaking occurs here.|

- Earthquakes occur in the **lithosphere** (up to 200 km deep).
    
- Seismic waves radiate outward from the focus in all directions.

## 🌊 **3. Earthquake Waves**

### A. **Types of Seismic Waves**

|**Wave Type**|**Sub-Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|**Body Waves**|**P-waves**|Primary waves, fastest, travel through solids, liquids, gases. Vibration is **parallel** to wave direction.|
||**S-waves**|Secondary waves, slower, travel only through **solids**. Vibration is **perpendicular** to wave direction.|
|**Surface Waves**|-|Slowest but most **destructive**. Cause horizontal and vertical ground motion.|

## 📊 **4. Seismograph and Wave Recording**

- A **seismograph** is an instrument that **records earthquake waves**.
    
- It displays **three distinct wave sections**: P, S, and Surface waves.
    
- Seismographs help determine the **epicentre** and **magnitude** of an earthquake.

## 🚫 **5. Shadow Zones**

|**Zone**|**Wave Behavior**|
|---|---|
|**Within 105°**|Both P and S waves detected.|
|**Between 105°–145°**|**No P or S waves** recorded (shadow zone).|
|**Beyond 145°**|**Only P-waves** recorded; S-waves blocked (they can’t pass through liquids).|

- Shadow zones helped confirm the **liquid nature of the Earth’s outer core**.

## 📏 **6. Measuring Earthquakes**

|**Scale**|**Measures**|**Range**|**Type**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Richter Scale**|Energy released (magnitude)|0 to 10|Logarithmic|
|**Mercalli Scale**|Damage and effect (intensity)|I to XII|Subjective, visual|

## ⚠️ **7. Effects of Earthquakes**

### A. **On Ground and Landscape**

- Ground shaking and displacement
    
- Landslides, mudslides, avalanches
    
- Soil liquefaction
    
- River course changes and reservoir formation
    

### B. **On Man-Made Structures**

- Collapse of buildings, bridges, roads
    
- Damage to dams, pipelines, railways
    
- Fire outbreaks due to gas leaks
    
- Disruption of electricity, communication, and transport
    

### C. **On Water Bodies**

- **Tsunamis**: Triggered if epicentre is under ocean floor (Richter 5+).
    
- Cause sea-floor displacement and powerful waves.
    
- Can travel thousands of km at high speed.
    

### D. **Socio-Environmental Impact**

- Homelessness, fear, trauma
    
- Epidemics due to poor sanitation
    
- Destruction of infrastructure and socio-economic losses

## 🌐 **8. Global Distribution of Earthquakes**

### 🔥 **Earthquake Belts**

|**Region**|**Characteristics**|
|---|---|
|**Circum-Pacific Belt**|“Ring of Fire”; around the Pacific Ocean; many volcanoes and deep quakes.|
|**Alpine-Himalayan Belt**|Includes Himalayas and Alps; high seismicity due to plate collisions.|
|**Mid-Oceanic Ridges**|Shallow earthquakes; divergent boundaries in oceans like Atlantic and Indian.|

## 🇮🇳 **9. Earthquakes in India**

### 📍 **Seismic Zones of India (Zone V to Zone II)**

|**Zone**|**Risk Level**|**Regions**|
|---|---|---|
|**Zone V**|Very High Risk|North-east India, Northern Bihar (Darbhanga, Araria), Uttarakhand, Kashmir Valley, Kutch|
|**Zone IV**|High Risk|Remaining J&K, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Northern UP, Eastern Haryana, Punjab|
|**Zone III**|Moderate Risk|Parts of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Kerala, West Bengal|
|**Zone II & I**|Low/Very Low Risk|Parts of Central and Southern India (Peninsular region)|

- **Himalayan arc and Northeast India** are **most active** due to Indian Plate movement.

### ✅ **Preparedness Measures**

|**Strategy**|**Details**|
|---|---|
|**Seismological Centres**|For monitoring and early warning.|
|**Vulnerability Mapping**|Identify and educate at-risk zones.|
|**Building Design Modifications**|Encourage earthquake-resistant structures.|
|**Construction Regulation**|Discourage high-rise, heavy construction in high-risk areas.|

## 🌋 **11. Earthquakes and Related Phenomena**

|**Phenomenon**|**Link to Earthquakes**|
|---|---|
|**Tsunami**|Undersea earthquakes displace ocean floor → water displacement → massive sea waves.|
|**Landslides**|Triggered by ground shaking in hilly terrain (Himalayas, Western Ghats).|
|**Volcanic Activity**|Often linked, especially in tectonic zones like the Pacific Ring of Fire.|
