# Volcanoes 

## **1. Definition and Mechanism**

- A **volcano** is an opening or **vent in the earth’s crust** through which **molten rock (lava)**, **rock fragments**, **ash**, **steam**, and **gases** are emitted.
    
- These emissions originate from the **hot interior of the Earth**, escaping through **lines of weakness** in the crust.
    
- Volcanoes are a result of **intense internal heat and pressure**.
    
- **Magma** is the hot molten rock beneath the crust; once it reaches the surface, it is called **lava**.
    
- The **tremendous force** of magma and trapped gases breaks through the crust, leading to eruptions.
    
- This process is known as **vulcanism** – the release of solid, liquid, and gaseous materials from within the Earth to its surface.

## **2. Volcanic Materials**

- Materials ejected during eruptions include:
    
    - **Lava flows**
        
    - **Pyroclastic debris**
        
    - **Volcanic bombs**
        
    - **Ash and dust**
        
    - **Gases**: nitrogen compounds, sulphur compounds, chlorine, hydrogen, and argon.

## **3. Sources of Information About Earth's Interior**

- **Volcanic eruptions provide direct access** to magma from deep inside the Earth, enabling **laboratory analysis**.
    
- However, it remains difficult to determine the **exact depth** of magma origin.

## **4. Classification of Volcanoes**

### **A. Based on Nature of Eruption and Form**

1. **Shield Volcanoes**
    
    - Largest volcanoes (e.g., **Hawaiian volcanoes**).
        
    - Composed mostly of **fluid basalt lava**.
        
    - Have **gentle slopes** and low explosivity unless water interacts with the vent.
        
    - Lava fountains can form **cinder cones** at the vent.
        
2. **Composite Volcanoes**
    
    - Erupt **cooler, more viscous lava**, often explosively.
        
    - Emit **lava, ash, and pyroclastic material**.
        
    - Result in **layered structures** around vent areas.
        
3. **Caldera**
    
    - **Most explosive** type.
        
    - The eruption is so violent that the volcano **collapses into itself**, forming a **depression**.
        
    - Indicates a **large, shallow magma chamber**.
        
4. **Flood Basalt Provinces**
    
    - Erupt **highly fluid lava** over **large areas**.
        
    - Form **thick basalt sheets** (up to 50 m thick, hundreds of km wide).
        
    - Example: **Deccan Traps**, India.
        
5. **Mid-Ocean Ridge Volcanoes**
    
    - Found along the **mid-ocean ridges**, over **70,000 km** long.
        
    - Characterized by **frequent eruptions** at the central ridge axis.

### **B. Based on Frequency of Eruption**

1. **Active Volcanoes**
    
    - Erupt **frequently or recently**.
        
    - Examples: **Stromboli**, **Krakatoa**, **Mayon**, **Mauna Loa**, **Barren Island (India)**.
        
2. **Dormant Volcanoes**
    
    - Erupted in historical times but are currently **inactive**.
        
    - Examples: **Vesuvius (Italy)**, **Cotopaxi (South America)**.
        
3. **Extinct Volcanoes**
    
    - **No record of eruption** in human history.
        

---

### **C. Based on Mode of Eruption**

1. **Central Type Volcanoes**
    
    - Erupt through a **single vent or hole**.
        
    - Form **domes or conical hills**.
        
    - Often **violent** due to sudden release of gases and lava.
        
    - Examples: **Vesuvius**, **Fuji-Yama**.
        
2. **Fissure Type Volcanoes**
    
    - Magma flows from **elongated cracks**, not central vents.
        
    - Produces **horizontal lava sheets** or **dome-shaped structures**.
        
    - Example: **Deccan Traps** (lava plateaus).

### **D. Based on Fluidity of Lava**

1. **Basic Lava Volcanoes**
    
    - **Rich in metallic minerals**, low melting point, **high fluidity**.
        
    - Lava spreads in **thin, extensive sheets**.
        
    - Forms **shields or domes**.
        
    - Example: **Hawaiian shield volcanoes**.
        
2. **Acid Lava Volcanoes**
    
    - **Rich in silica**, high melting point, **high viscosity**.
        
    - Lava solidifies quickly, forming **steep cones**.
        
    - Associated with **higher land features** and **steep slopes**.

## **5. Volcanic Landforms**

### **A. Extrusive Landforms**

- Formed by **volcanic materials accumulating on the surface**.
    
- **Common Features**:
    
    - **Volcanic cones** with **craters**
        
    - **Shield volcanoes**, **composite cones**, **cinder cones**, **calderas**, **flood basalt provinces**
        
    - **Seamounts** (underwater volcanoes that don’t reach the surface)
        
    - **Volcanic mountains** (e.g., **Mauna Loa**, **Mount Popa**, **Vesuvius**, **Cotopaxi**, **Fuji Yama**)
        
    - **Volcanic plateaus** (e.g., **Maharashtra Plateau**, **Snake River Plateau** in the USA)
        

### **B. Intrusive Landforms**

- Formed when **lava cools within the crust**, solidifying into **igneous rocks**.
    

1. **Lacoliths** – Dome-shaped, intrusive bodies with flat bases. Found in **Karnataka** (domal granite hills).
    
2. **Lapoliths** – Saucer-shaped bodies (concave upward).
    
3. **Phacoliths** – Wavy igneous bodies at **anticline tops** or **syncline bases**.
    
4. **Sills and Sheets** – **Horizontal layers** of solidified lava (sills = thicker; sheets = thinner).
    
5. **Dykes** – **Vertical, wall-like structures** of solidified lava. Common in **Western Maharashtra**.
    
6. **Batholiths** – **Massive underground magma bodies**, forming **mountain cores**.

## **7. Hazards from Volcanoes**

- **Volcanic eruptions** cause sudden and drastic surface changes.
    
- **Mudflows (lahars)** form when volcanic debris mixes with rainwater, causing **destructive floods**.
    
    - Common in **Andes and Rockies**.
