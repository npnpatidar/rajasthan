    * **Autocratic/Authoritative:**
        * Leader retains power and authority.
        * No delegation of power to subordinates.
        * No consultation with subordinates.
        * One-way communication.
        * **Advantages:** Quick decision-making, quick results, suitable for unskilled/uneducated subordinates.
        * **Disadvantages:** Frustration and low morale among subordinates, underutilization of subordinate initiative.

        * Leader takes decisions in consultation with subordinates.
        * Delegation of authority and rights to subordinates.
        * Two-way communication.
        * Suitable where job satisfaction and employee autonomy are important.
        * **Advantages:** Job satisfaction, high morale, improved decision-making, positive attitudes, increased efficiency, better resource utilization.

    * **Free-Rein/Laissez-Faire:**
        * Leader avoids power and delegates all rights and authority to subordinates.
        * Subordinates make their own decisions.
        * **Advantages:** Job satisfaction, full utilization of subordinate potential, decreased workload for leader.

## V. Theories of Leadership

* **Traditional Theories:**
    * **Great Man Theory (Thomas Carlyle):**  Leaders are born, not made; hero worship; followers only interested in leader selection, not performance.
    * **Trait Theory (Barnard & Tead):** Leaders are made, not born;  focuses on identifying and developing leadership qualities (traits).


* **Modern Theories:**
    * **Behavioral Theory:** Emphasizes leader's behavior rather than personal qualities; focuses on what leaders do (e.g., how they lead, motivate, communicate).
    * **Situational/Contingency Theory:** Leadership effectiveness depends on situational variables (leader-follower relationship, task structure, leader position). Effectiveness depends on favorable conditions of these three elements.


* **Charismatic Leadership:**  Leader uses communication skills, motivational power, and attractive personality to influence people; often seen as divinely appointed; elements include heroism, divine origin, and charismatic characteristics; features include vision, confidence, optimism, and masterful communication skills.
