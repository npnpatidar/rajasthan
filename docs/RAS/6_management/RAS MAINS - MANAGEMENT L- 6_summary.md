## IV. Theories of Motivation

### A. Traditional Theories

* **Fear and Punishment Theory:** Employees work primarily out of fear of punishment.
* **Reward Theory:** Employees continue working as long as they receive adequate benefits.
* **Carrot and Stick Theory:** Rewards for good work, punishment for bad work, based on productivity.


### B. Modern Theories

* **McGregor's X and Y Theory:**

    * **Theory X (Classical):**  Instructional management; work and product-oriented.  Workers are uninterested in work, avoid it, need direction, and are motivated by fear and punishment.
    * **Theory Y (Behavioral):** Participative management; workers are interested in work, take initiative, are efficient, self-directed, and work-centric; motivated by self-respect and self-esteem.

* **Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs:** A five-level hierarchical model of human needs:

    * **Physiological Needs:** Breathing, food, water, shelter, sleep.
    * **Safety and Security Needs:** Security of body, employment, resources, morality, family, health, property.
    * **Love and Belonging Needs:** Friendship, family, intimacy, sense of connection.
    * **Esteem Needs:** Self-esteem, confidence, achievement, respect of others, respect by others.
    * **Self-Actualization Needs:** Morality, creativity, spontaneity, problem-solving, lack of prejudice, acceptance of facts.

    **Key Aspects of Maslow's Theory:**
    * Human needs are infinite.
    * The order of needs is generally predictable.
    * Motivation stops when a need is satisfied; individuals only move to higher-level needs after lower-level needs are fulfilled.

* **Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory:**

    * **Hygiene Factors (Extrinsic):** Related to the work environment; their presence reduces dissatisfaction, but their absence does not necessarily increase satisfaction. Examples: work conditions, interpersonal relations, salary, security.
    * **Motivators (Intrinsic):** Related to the work content itself; their presence increases satisfaction. Examples: growth, responsibility, achievement, recognition.


* **Ouchi's Theory Z (J-Theory):**  Focuses on building trust, stability, and intimacy.  Key elements: lifetime employment, slow evaluation and promotion, generalist managers, humane treatment of workers, and collective decision-making.
