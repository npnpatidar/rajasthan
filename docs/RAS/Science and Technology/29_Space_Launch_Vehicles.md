# India's Launch Vehicle Technology

India's space program has seen significant evolution in its launch vehicle technology, enabling the country to achieve self-reliance in space access.

## What is a Launch Vehicle?

A launch vehicle, also known as a rocket, is a transportation system designed to _carry a payload (satellites, spacecraft, or humans) from Earth’s surface into space_. It provides the necessary velocity and altitude to overcome Earth's gravity. Once near the intended orbit, satellites are ejected.

## Evolution of ISRO's Launch Vehicles

India's launch vehicle development began in _1969 under Dr. Vikram Sarabhai_, with the vision of achieving self-reliance in space technology.

*   **Early Beginnings (1960s)**: Started with sounding rockets. The first sounding rocket, _Nike-Apache_, was launched from Thumba, Kerala, in 1963, marking the program's start.
*   **1970s**: Developed _SLV_ and _ASLV_ launch vehicles.
*   **1980s**: _SLV-3_ made India the 6th or 7th nation to independently reach Earth orbit.
*   **1990s**: _PSLV_ development began, and _GSLV_ was conceived for geostationary orbit.
*   **2000s**: _LVM3_ (GSLV Mk III) development started for heavier satellites.
*   **2010s**: ISRO launched the _Reusable Launch Vehicle Technology Demonstrator (RLV-TD)_ in 2016.
*   **2020s**: _SSLV_ (Small Satellite Launch Vehicle) was developed for small satellites, and the _Next-Gen Launch Vehicle (NGLV)_ is planned to replace existing rockets.

## Propellant Technology

Rocket propulsion relies on _Newton's Third Law of Motion_, where the expulsion of hot gases downward generates an upward thrust. Propellants are a combination of fuel and oxidizer.

### Solid Propellants

*   _Fuel_: Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB).
*   _Oxidizer_: Ammonium Perchlorate.
*   _Advantages_: Compact, energy-dense, high thrust, minimal maintenance. Used for quick-response missiles due to simplicity and reliability.
*   _Disadvantages_: Thrust cannot be controlled or stopped once ignited.
*   _Applications_: Short-to-medium range ballistic missiles (e.g., Prithvi, BrahMos), and first/third stages of PSLV.

### Liquid Propellants

*   _Fuel_: Unsymmetrical Dimethylhydrazine (UDMH), Mono Methyl Hydrazine (MMH), Liquid Hydrogen (LH2).
*   _Oxidizer_: Nitrogen Tetroxide (N2O4), Mixed Oxides of Nitrogen (MON), Liquid Oxygen (LOX).
*   _Advantages_: Thrust can be controlled (started, stopped, throttled), high energy efficiency.
*   _Disadvantages_: Complex design, requires more preparation time and handling safety.
*   _Applications_: Long-range missiles, space launch vehicles (e.g., Agni series, Akash), and stages of PSLV and GSLV.

### Cryogenic Propellants

*   _Description_: Uses fuels (Liquid Hydrogen, -253°C) and oxidizers (Liquid Oxygen, -183°C) stored at _extremely low temperatures_.
*   **Advantages**:
    *   _High energy density_ per unit mass, allowing for longer ranges and heavier payloads.
    *   _Clean fuel_, producing only water upon combustion.
    *   _Economical_, as fuel is cheap and readily available.
    *   Essential for heavy satellites (2500-3000 kg) in Geo-stationary orbit and manned space flights.
*   **Disadvantages**:
    *   _Complex handling and storage_ due to extremely low temperatures and high volatility.
    *   Challenges include complex stage combustion cycles, high temperature variation (over 3000°C in thrust chamber), and material/alloy requirements for the engine.
*   _Global Status_: Only a few countries (USA, Russia, China, Japan, France) possess this technology. India became the sixth.
*   _Applications_: Employed in heavy-lift space missions (e.g., GSLV Mk III) and long-range ballistic missiles (e.g., Agni-V).

### Hybrid Propellants

*   Combines solid fuel and liquid oxidizer.
*   _Advantages_: Offers better control over thrust compared to solid propulsion.
*   _Applications_: Used for experimental systems and advanced prototypes (e.g., BrahMos Hypersonic Cruise Missile prototype).

### Air-Breathing Engines (Ramjet, Scramjet)

*   Utilizes atmospheric oxygen as the oxidizer, making the missile lighter as it doesn't need to carry onboard oxidizers.
*   _Ramjet_: Works at supersonic speeds by compressing incoming air before combustion.
*   _Scramjet_: Operates at hypersonic speeds, where air is compressed and combusted without slowing it to subsonic speeds.
*   _Advantages_: Extremely fuel-efficient, enables hypersonic flight and extended ranges.
*   _Disadvantages_: Limited to regions with sufficient atmospheric oxygen, unsuitable for space.
*   _Applications_: Hypersonic missiles and advanced cruise missiles (e.g., BrahMos-II, HGV).
