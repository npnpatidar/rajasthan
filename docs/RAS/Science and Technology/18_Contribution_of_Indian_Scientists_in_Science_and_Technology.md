# India's Legacy of Science and Innovation

India has a long and continuous tradition of significant scholarship in various fields, including mathematics, astronomy, linguistics, logic, and ethics. Science, meaning '*to know*' (from Latin "Scientia," similar to Sanskrit "Vijnan" and Arabic "Ilm"), is as old as human civilization, with early contributions from India among other ancient societies. By the mid-20th century, science became a truly international endeavor, with many cultures and countries contributing to its rapid growth.
