**2. Functions:** Modification of proteins and lipids (glycosylation and lipid modification), packaging, and transport of these modified molecules to their destinations (cell membrane, lysosomes, or extracellular environment). It also participates in the formation of lysosomes.  It helps in the formation of lysosomes, which break down cellular waste products.  It controls the secretion of hormones, enzymes, and other proteins from the cell.  Examples include enzyme-secreting cells in the pancreas that have active Golgi bodies.  It helps in the formation and repair of the new cell membrane.  In plant cells, it helps in the synthesis of pectin and cellulose for cell wall construction.


## Lysosome:

**1. Structure:** Single membrane-bound organelles containing hydrolytic enzymes like proteases, lipases, nucleases, amylases, etc. These enzymes function at an acidic pH (~5).  They originate from the Golgi apparatus.

**2. Functions:**  Digests waste materials like damaged cell parts, dead cells, and unwanted substances using hydrolytic enzymes.  It performs autolysis (self-destruction) of the cell when the cell is damaged or useless. It is also known as the "suicidal bag of the cell."  It participates in endocytosis and phagocytosis, destroying bacteria and other harmful particles;  in white blood cells, it helps destroy pathogens.  It manages waste and recycling by breaking down old and damaged organelles to make reusable materials for the cell.  It helps in cell division and growth by assisting in the restructuring of the cell during division.

**Types of Lysosomes:**

*   **Primary Lysosomes:** Formed directly from the Golgi body and store hydrolytic enzymes.
*   **Secondary Lysosomes:** Formed when primary lysosomes fuse with a phagocytic vesicle, actively digesting particles.
*   **Autophagic Lysosomes:**  Destroy and recycle old cell organelles.
*   **Heterophagic Lysosomes:** Ingest and destroy external substances through phagocytosis.


## Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):

**1. Structure:** A membrane-bound cellular structure found in eukaryotic cells. It plays a vital role in the synthesis, storage, and transport of materials within the cell.  There are two main types:

*   **Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (SER):** Lacks ribosomes on its surface, giving it a smooth appearance.  It helps in lipid and steroid synthesis, detoxification in the cell, and calcium ion (Ca2+) storage.


**2. Functions:**

*   Synthesis of proteins and lipids: RER synthesizes proteins, while SER produces lipids and steroid hormones.
*   Transport of substances: It carries molecules from one location to another within the cell.
*   Detoxification: SER neutralizes toxic substances, making them less harmful.
*   Storage of calcium ions: Especially in muscle cells, SER stores calcium ions, which aid in contraction.







## 5. Relationship with Golgi Apparatus

Proteins and lipids originating from the ER are modified in the Golgi apparatus and transported to their final destinations.

## (vi) Chloroplast

A chloroplast is a membrane-bound organelle found only in plant and some algal cells. It is responsible for the process of photosynthesis, by which plants make food (glucose) using sunlight.

### Structure:

The structure of a chloroplast is complex and includes several important parts:

1.  **Double Membrane:** The chloroplast is surrounded by a double membrane (outer & inner membrane) that provides protection and regulates the transport of substances.
2.  **Stroma:** This is the fluid-filled space inside the chloroplast, containing enzymes, DNA, ribosomes, and other molecules.  It houses the Calvin cycle, which aids in glucose synthesis.
3.  **Thylakoid:** These are membranous structures stacked like "coins" on top of each other, and are called grana (singular: granum).  The thylakoid membrane contains chlorophyll, which absorbs sunlight.
4.  **Chlorophyll & Other Pigments:** Chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-b are green pigments that absorb light and convert it into energy. Other pigments like carotenoids are also present, which act as accessory light absorbers.

### Functions:

1.  **Photosynthesis:** Chloroplasts use sunlight, water (H₂O), and carbon dioxide (CO₂) to produce oxygen (O₂) and glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆). This process occurs in two stages:
    *   **Light Reactions:** Occur in the thylakoid membrane and produce ATP and NADPH.
    *   **Dark Reactions/Calvin Cycle:** Occurs in the stroma and involves the synthesis of glucose.
2.  **Oxygen Production:** During photosynthesis, chloroplasts release oxygen gas, which is useful for respiration in living organisms.
3.  **Amino Acid & Fatty Acid Synthesis:** Chloroplasts produce several organic compounds that aid in plant growth and development.
4.  **Own DNA:** Chloroplasts possess their own DNA (circular DNA) and ribosomes, enabling them to synthesize some of their own proteins.  This is called a semi-autonomous organelle.

### Importance:

*   It is essential for life on Earth as it forms the base of the food chain.
*   It maintains the balance of oxygen in the atmosphere.


## (vii) Centriole

A centriole is a microtubular structure found mostly in animal cells and some lower plants and protists. It plays a significant role in cell division and microtubule organization.

### Structure:

1.  **Tubular Structure:** A centriole is a cylindrical structure made up of microtubules. It has a 9 + 0 structure, meaning 9 groups of 3 microtubules each are present, and there are no microtubules in the center.
2.  **Present in Pairs:** Centrioles are usually found in pairs, called a centrosome.  It assists in the formation of spindle fibers during cell division.

### Functions:

1.  **Role in Cell Division:** Centrioles build spindle fibers during mitosis and meiosis, which help separate chromosomes.
2.  **Microtubule Organization:** It helps maintain the cell's structure (cytoskeleton) and regulate the position of organelles.
3.  **Cilia & Flagella Formation:** It helps in the formation of cilia and flagella by forming the basal body, allowing for cell movement.
4.  **Organizing Golgi Apparatus and Vesicles:** It assists in the organization of the Golgi apparatus and other membrane-bound vesicles within the cell.

### Importance:

*   Essential organelle for cell division, especially in animal cells.
*   Without centrioles, cell division may be slow or irregular.
*   It helps in the proper segregation of chromosomes, ensuring genetic stability.


### Cell Division

Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more new daughter cells. It is essential for the growth, development, tissue repair, and reproduction of organisms.

### Types of Cell Division:

There are mainly three types of cell division:

1.  **Mitosis:** This is an equal type of division, where two daughter cells are formed from the parent cell, with the same number of chromosomes.  This division aids in general body growth, tissue repair, and regeneration.
    *   **Stages of Mitosis:**
        *   **Interphase:** The cell prepares for division, DNA replication occurs.
        *   **Prophase:** Chromosomes condense, centrioles move toward the poles.







## Types of Cell Division (Continued):

1.  **Mitosis:** (Continued from previous chunk)
    *   **Stages of Mitosis:**
        *   **Prophase:** Chromosomes condense, centrioles move toward the poles.
        *   **Metaphase:** Chromosomes align at the equatorial plate.
        *   **Anaphase:** Chromatids move towards opposite poles.
        *   **Telophase:** New nuclei are formed, cell division is complete.
        *   **Cytokinesis:** Cytoplasm divides, forming two new cells.

    *   **Where does Mitosis occur?**
        *   In somatic cells (general body cells).
        *   In skin, bone marrow, and meristematic cells of roots and stems.


2.  **Meiosis:**  This is a special type of cell division where four daughter cells are formed from the parent cell, each with half the number of chromosomes (haploid, n). It occurs in the formation of gametes (sex cells: sperm and egg).

    *   **Stages of Meiosis:**
        *   **Meiosis I:** Chromosome number is halved. Genetic variation occurs through crossing over.
        *   **Meiosis II:** Similar to mitosis. Four new daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes are formed.

    *   **Where does Meiosis occur?**
        *   In reproductive cells.
        *   In the ovaries and testes.


3.  **Amitosis:** This is the simplest and most direct type of cell division. There is no proper separation of chromosomes, and the cell directly divides into two parts.


## Importance of Cell Division:

1.  Growth:  New cells are formed, contributing to body growth.
2.  Tissue Repair: Damaged cells are regenerated.
3.  Reproduction: Aids in sexual and asexual reproduction.
4.  Genetic Variation: Produced by meiosis, leading to species evolution.
5.  Replacement of Old Cells: New cells replace old ones.


## Ch-2 "Control and Coordination in Animals"

### Nervous System in Animals

The nervous system in animals controls the exchange of information between different body parts. It helps the body respond to internal and external changes.


### Structure of the Nervous System

The nervous system is divided into two main parts:

**(A) Central Nervous System (CNS)**

*   Includes the brain and spinal cord.
*   Controls and coordinates the entire body.

    *   **(i) Brain:**
        *   **Forebrain:** Controls thinking, memory, language, and sensory activities (vision, hearing, smell).
        *   **Midbrain:** Controls visual and auditory responses.
        *   **Hindbrain:** Controls balance, coordination, and involuntary actions (heartbeat, respiration).

    *   **(ii) Spinal Cord:**
        *   Transmits information between the brain and other parts of the body.
        *   Controls reflex actions.


**(B) Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)**

*   A network of nerves connecting different body parts to the central nervous system.
*   Contains two types of nerves:
    *   **Sensory Nerves:** Transmit signals from the external environment to the brain.
    *   **Motor Nerves:** Receive commands from the brain and activate organs.


**(C) Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)**

*   Controls involuntary functions of the body (heartbeat, digestion, sweating).
*   Has two parts:
    *   **Sympathetic Nervous System:** Prepares the body for stress, fear, or danger (fight or flight response).
    *   **Parasympathetic Nervous System:** Returns the body to a normal state.


### Neuron and its Structure

The basic component of the nervous system is the neuron. It carries nerve impulses from one place to another.  Parts of a neuron include:

1.  **Cell Body:** Contains the nucleus and other cellular organelles.
2.  **Dendrites:** Short branches that receive signals and transmit them to the cell body.
3.  **Axon:** A long fiber-like structure that sends signals to other parts of the body.
4.  **Synapse:** The gap between two neurons where chemical signals (neurotransmitters) transmit messages.


### Functions of the Nervous System

1.  **Sensory Function:** Receives information from the external environment (temperature, light, sound).
2.  **Integrative Function:** Analyzes and makes decisions based on received signals.
3.  **Motor Function:** Stimulates organs to respond.


### Reflex Action

A reflex action is a quick and automatic response controlled by the spinal cord, not the brain. Examples include:

*   Immediately withdrawing the hand after touching a hot object.
*   Blinking the eyes instantly when dust enters them.


### Reflex Arc Pathway




## Plant Coordination

Plant coordination occurs without a nervous system and relies on chemical and physical processes. Plants regulate their growth and responses to external changes.

### Types of Plant Coordination

**(A) Quick Response:** Some plants show rapid responses to external touch or other stimuli. For example, the touch-me-not plant (Mimosa pudica) instantly closes its leaves when touched. This is based on turgor movement.

**(B) Growth-Related Coordination:** This is a slower response where plants regulate their growth based on external cues like light, gravity, water, and touch. Plant hormones play a crucial role.


### Plant Hormones and Their Functions

*   **Auxin:** Regulates plant growth and helps them bend towards light. Found in stems and roots.
*   **Gibberellin:** Increases plant length and helps in seed germination. Present in seeds, roots, and leaves.
*   **Cytokinin:** Promotes cell division and prevents old leaves from falling. Found in roots and fruits.
*   **Ethylene:** Helps ripen fruits and contributes to flower dropping. Found especially in fruits.
*   **Abscisic Acid:** Maintains dormancy and helps close leaf stomata during water scarcity. Present in roots and leaves.


### Plant Movements and Their Types

*   **Phototropism:** When a plant bends towards the direction of light.  For example, sunflowers turn towards the sun.
*   **Geotropism:** Plants respond to gravity. For example, roots always grow towards the earth, while the stem grows upwards.
*   **Hydrotropism:** When plant roots grow towards a water source. This helps plants absorb more moisture from water sources.
*   **Thigmotropism:** Some plants respond to touch. Climbing plants, like peas and grapes, bend their stems to grasp support.
*   **Chemotropism:** When plants grow towards a chemical. For example, the pollen tube grows towards the ovule.


## Hormonal Coordination in Animals

Coordination in animals happens through the nervous system and the endocrine system. The nervous system provides quick responses, while the hormonal system offers slow but long-lasting responses. Hormonal coordination happens through hormones produced by endocrine glands. These hormones reach different body parts through the bloodstream and regulate their functions.

### Hormones and Their Functions

**(A) Hormones Related to Growth and Development:** Body growth and development depend on hormones secreted by endocrine glands. These hormones regulate cell division, tissue formation, bone length, metabolism, and other biological processes.

1.  **Growth Hormone (GH):** Secreted by the pituitary gland and controls overall body growth. It promotes bone and muscle growth. Excess can cause gigantism, while deficiency leads to dwarfism.
2.  **Thyroxine:** Secreted by the thyroid gland. It regulates body metabolism, affecting energy production and cell growth. Iodine is necessary for thyroxine production. Iodine deficiency can cause goiter, a swelling in the neck.
3.  **Gibberellin (Plant Hormone):** Controls plant growth and helps increase stem length. It aids seed germination and flower formation.
4.  **Cytokinin (Plant Hormone):** Promotes cell division and helps develop new branches in plants. It prevents old leaves from falling and ensures proper nutrient distribution in plants.
5.  **Insulin and Glucagon:** Both hormones are secreted by the pancreas and maintain sugar balance in the body. Insulin controls blood glucose levels and stores it as energy in cells. Glucagon releases stored glucose when blood sugar is low, providing energy. Insulin deficiency can cause diabetes.
6.  **Testosterone and Estrogen:** Testosterone is secreted by the testes in males and regulates sexual growth and muscle development. Estrogen is secreted by the ovaries in females and regulates menstruation.





## Hormones: A Detailed Overview (Page 1)

**(B) Hormones that function during stress and emergency situations:**

The adrenal gland secretes specific hormones to prepare the body for stressful and emergency situations. These hormones increase the body's energy, alertness, and responsiveness, enabling individuals to cope with challenging or dangerous situations.

**1. Adrenaline (Epinephrine): "Emergency Hormone"**

Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, activates the body's "fight or flight" response.  It's secreted by the adrenal gland, located above the kidneys. When a person experiences stress, fear, or danger, this hormone floods the bloodstream, preparing the body for immediate reaction. It increases heart rate, regulates blood pressure, and generates more energy in the body. It also alerts the brain and strengthens muscles, allowing for quicker responses.

**Effects of Adrenaline:**

* Increased heart rate.
* Increased breathing rate.
* Increased blood and oxygen supply to muscles.
* Slowed digestion to conserve energy.
* Dilated pupils, making the individual more alert.

**2. Noradrenaline (Noradrenaline)**

This functions similarly to adrenaline, but primarily helps increase blood pressure by constricting blood vessels.  It assists the individual in recovering from stress or shock and keeps the brain active and alert.

**3. Cortisol: "Stress Hormone"**

Cortisol is a major stress hormone secreted by the adrenal cortex. It helps the body adapt to long-term stress and critical situations. It raises blood sugar levels, providing more energy. It affects the immune system and reduces inflammation. It keeps the brain alert, aiding in decision-making during crises.

**Effects of Cortisol:**

* Assists the body in coping with long-term stress.
* Maintains energy levels.
* Regulates blood pressure.
* Slows the activities of the digestive system and immune system.

**4. Glucagon: Energy Balance Hormone**

Glucagon, secreted by the pancreas, increases glucose availability in the body, providing more energy to the brain and muscles.  It provides necessary energy during stress, hunger, or emergencies. It converts glycogen stored in the liver into glucose and releases it into the bloodstream.

**(C) Hormones that regulate blood sugar:**

Blood glucose levels are regulated according to the body's energy needs. This control is primarily achieved through hormones secreted by the pancreas. The pancreas contains a group of cells called the Islets of Langerhans.


## Hormones: A Detailed Overview (Page 2)

**1. Insulin: Blood Sugar Lowering Hormone**

Insulin is secreted by the beta cells of the pancreas. It reduces blood glucose levels. When we eat, carbohydrates are digested into glucose and absorbed into the blood. In this situation, insulin signals cells to absorb glucose from the blood and store it as energy or glycogen.  Most glucose is stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles.

**What happens due to insulin deficiency?**

If the body doesn't produce enough insulin or cells don't respond properly, blood glucose levels rise excessively, potentially leading to diabetes mellitus.  Diabetics require insulin injections to maintain balanced blood sugar.

**2. Glucagon: Blood Sugar Raising Hormone**

Glucagon is secreted by the alpha cells of the pancreas. It increases blood glucose levels. When the body needs more energy, such as during fasting or strenuous exercise, glucagon signals the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose and release it into the blood. This increases blood glucose levels and provides the body with necessary energy.

**3. Adrenaline: Blood Sugar Raising Hormone in Emergencies**

Adrenaline (epinephrine), secreted by the adrenal gland, activates the body's "fight or flight" response. When a person is under stress, fear, or in an emergency, adrenaline signals the liver to convert glycogen into glucose and release it into the bloodstream. This provides rapid energy to the muscles and brain.

**4. Cortisol: Blood Sugar Raising Hormone in Long-Term Stress**

Cortisol, secreted by the adrenal cortex, helps regulate blood sugar during long-term stress. It helps the body convert protein and fat into glucose, providing long-term energy. Excessive cortisol levels can lead to problems like diabetes, obesity, and hypertension.

**(D) Hormones related to reproduction and sexual development:**

Hormones play a crucial role in reproduction and sexual development. These hormones regulate sexual characteristics, the menstrual cycle, sperm and egg production, and pregnancy. These hormones are primarily secreted by the pituitary gland and gonads.

**1. Testosterone: Male Hormone**

It is secreted by the testes and regulates primary and secondary sexual characteristics in males.




**(E) Other Important Hormones and Their Functions:**

Several other hormones play crucial roles in maintaining bodily functions.  These include:

**1. Estrogen (Female Hormone):**

Secreted by the ovaries, estrogen regulates female sexual development and the reproductive system. It controls the menstrual cycle and contributes to breast development.  Estrogen also helps maintain strong bones and contributes to cardiovascular health.  A deficiency can lead to menstrual irregularities, osteoporosis, and an increased risk of heart disease.

**2. Progesterone (Pregnancy Hormone):**

Secreted by the ovaries and uterus, progesterone is essential for maintaining pregnancy. It thickens the uterine lining to support a fertilized egg.  If fertilization doesn't occur, progesterone levels drop, initiating menstruation. During pregnancy, it relaxes uterine muscles to prevent premature contractions.

**3. Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH):**

These hormones, secreted by the pituitary gland, regulate the reproductive system in both males and females.

*   **In females:** LH triggers ovulation (release of an egg), while FSH stimulates egg development in the ovaries.
*   **In males:** LH stimulates testosterone production in the testes, and FSH aids in sperm production.

**4. Oxytocin ("Love" and Labor Hormone):**

Released by the pituitary gland, oxytocin stimulates uterine contractions during childbirth and promotes milk production during breastfeeding. It's also associated with bonding between parent and child.

**5. Prolactin (Lactation Hormone):**

Also secreted by the pituitary gland, prolactin stimulates milk production in the mammary glands after pregnancy and childbirth. It also contributes to the mother-infant bond.

**(F) Endocrine Glands and Their Functions:**

Endocrine glands secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream, regulating growth, metabolism, reproduction, stress response, and other vital functions.

**1. Pituitary Gland ("Master Gland"):**

Located at the base of the brain, the pituitary gland controls other endocrine glands and secretes several important hormones, including: growth hormone (GH), prolactin, LH, FSH, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).

**2. Thyroid Gland:**

Situated in the neck near the larynx, the thyroid gland regulates metabolism, energy production, and bone development.  It secretes thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Iodine deficiency can lead to goiter.

**3. Parathyroid Gland:**

These small glands, located behind the thyroid gland, control calcium and phosphate levels in the body by secreting parathyroid hormone (PTH).

**4. Adrenal Gland ("Stress Hormone Gland"):**

Located atop each kidney, the adrenal glands regulate stress, water balance, and metabolism. They secrete adrenaline, noradrenaline, cortisol, and aldosterone.

**5. Pancreas ("Blood Sugar Control Gland"):**

Located behind the stomach, the pancreas controls blood glucose levels by secreting insulin (lowers blood sugar) and glucagon (raises blood sugar). Insulin deficiency leads to diabetes mellitus.

**6. Gonads ("Reproductive Hormone Glands"):**

*   **Testes (Male):** Located in the scrotum, the testes control male sexual characteristics and sperm production, secreting testosterone.
*   **Ovaries (Female):** Located in the pelvic region, the ovaries control egg production and the menstrual cycle, secreting estrogen.

**7. Thymus Gland – "Immune System Gland"**

*   **Location:** Located above the heart, in the chest.
*   **Function:** Strengthens the immune system.
*   **Secreted Hormone:**
    *   Thymosin: Activates white blood cells (WBC) in the body and helps fight infections.

**8. Pineal Gland – "Sleep Regulator Gland"**

*   **Location:** Located in the middle of the brain.
*   **Function:** Regulates sleep and the biological clock.
*   **Secreted Hormone:**
    *   Melatonin: Regulates the sleep cycle and adjusts the body according to day and night.

**Importance of Hormonal Coordination**

Hormones regulate various bodily processes, such as:

*   Physical growth and development
*   Metabolism and energy production
*   Stress and emergency response
*   Blood sugar control
*   Reproduction and sexual development


**Difference between Nervous System and Hormonal System**

The nervous system works through electrochemical signals and gives a very fast response, while the hormonal system is based on chemical signals and gives a relatively slower but longer-lasting response.


**Reflex Actions**

*   A reflex action is a quick and spontaneous response that helps protect the body from suddenly occurring external stimuli. This process is controlled by the spinal cord, not the brain.

**Examples:**

*   Pulling back the hand immediately upon touching a hot object.
*   Blinking eyelids when dust enters the eyes.
*   Immediately removing the foot when a nail pricks it.
*   Pupil constriction in response to bright light.
*   Jerking of the leg when the doctor hits the knee.


**Reflex Arc – Pathway of a Reflex Action**

A reflex action is controlled through a specific neural pathway called a reflex arc. It has five main components:

**Components of the Reflex Arc:**

1.  **Stimulus:** The external factor that produces a response (e.g., a hot object).
2.  **Receptor:** The organ that detects the stimulus (e.g., sensitive nerves in the skin).
3.  **Sensory Nerve:** The nerve that carries the stimulus to the spinal cord.
4.  **Spinal Cord:** Processes the message and sends instructions for the response.
5.  **Motor Nerve:** Carries the instructions from the spinal cord to the body part that reacts.
6.  **Effector Organ:** The organ that reacts (e.g., muscles of the hand).


**Process of the Reflex Arc:**

1. When you touch a hot object, the sensory nerves in the skin sense the heat.
2. This message travels through the sensory nerves to the spinal cord.
3. The spinal cord immediately sends an order to the motor nerve.
4. The motor nerve sends a message to the muscles to contract and withdraw the hand.
5. The hand immediately moves away from the hot object.

This whole process is very fast, and the brain is not given time to think.

**Types of Reflex Actions**

**(A) Natural Reflexes:** These are innate and occur automatically without any practice.

**Examples:**

*   A newborn baby moving its lips to suckle.
*   Blinking eyelids when dust enters the eyes.
*   Pupil constriction in bright light.
*   Sneezing or coughing.

**(B) Acquired Reflexes:** These develop through practice or experience.

**Examples:**

*   Applying brakes suddenly while cycling.
*   Blowing on hot tea before drinking.
*   Catching a ball with your hands while playing.


**Importance of Reflex Actions**

*   Quick response: Enables the body to respond immediately.
*   Protection: Protects the body from injury and harmful situations.
*   Energy conservation: No need for the brain to think, saving energy.
*   Life saving: Immediate response without thinking can save lives many times.


**Ch-3 Reproduction in Organisms**

Reproduction is the process by which organisms produce new organisms similar to themselves.  It is essential for maintaining biological existence and continuing generations.


**Types of Reproduction**

Reproduction is mainly divided into two types:

**Asexual Reproduction**

**Definition:** Asexual reproduction is a process in which only one parent participates and produces new organisms without the fusion of gametes. The offspring produced through this process are exact replicas of their parent, called "clones."

**Types of Asexual Reproduction:**

Asexual reproduction has several types found in various organisms:

1.  **Binary Fission:** In this process, the parent cell divides into two identical cells.  It is mainly found in unicellular organisms.  Examples: Amoeba, Paramecium, Euglena.
2.  **Multiple Fission:** One parent cell divides simultaneously into many cells. This process occurs in some organisms under adverse conditions. Examples: Plasmodium (malaria parasite), Bacteria.
3.  **Budding:** A small bud forms on the parent body, which gradually develops into a new organism. This new organism separates from the parent and lives independently. Examples: Yeast, Hydra.
4.  **Fragmentation:** Segments of the parent organism break off and develop into new organisms. This is seen mostly in simple multicellular organisms. Examples: Spirogyra, Starfish.





# Asexual Reproduction

5. **Sporulation:** Bacteria or fungi produce spores, which develop into new organisms under favorable conditions. These spores are lightweight and spread through air or water. Examples: *Rhizopus* (bread mold), ferns, algae.

6. **Vegetative Propagation:** This occurs only in plants where new plants develop from their parts (roots, stem, leaves). Examples:
    * Stem: Potato, ginger, sugarcane.
    * Leaves: *Bryophyllum*.
    * Roots: Sweet potato.
    * Cuttings and grafting: Rose, mango.


**Advantages of Asexual Reproduction:**

* Rapid population growth.
* Only one parent is needed.
* Low energy and time consumption.
* Increased survival in adverse conditions.

**Disadvantages of Asexual Reproduction:**

* Lack of genetic variation.
* Low adaptability to environmental changes.
* No development of new traits, resulting in slow evolution.


# Sexual Reproduction

**Definition:** Sexual reproduction is a process involving two parents (male and female) where their gametes fuse to produce a new organism.  This process shows genetic variation, increasing the chances of evolution.

**Stages of Sexual Reproduction:**

Sexual reproduction is completed in three main stages:

1. **Pre-fertilization Stage:** This stage includes events before fertilization. It has two major processes:

    (i) **Gametogenesis:** Formation of male and female gametes (sperm and ovum). Male gametes are light and motile, while female gametes are larger and immobile. Example: Sperm and ovum in humans.

    (ii) **Gamete Transfer:** Transfer of the male gamete to the female gamete. In higher organisms, this process happens through pollination or copulation.

2. **Fertilization Stage:** Fusion of male and female gametes occurs, forming a single-celled zygote.

    **Types of Fertilization:**
        * **Internal Fertilization:** Fertilization occurs inside the body. Example: Humans, birds, mammals.
        * **External Fertilization:** Fertilization occurs outside the body in water. Example: Frogs, fish.

3. **Post-fertilization Events:** The zygote divides to form an embryo, which develops into a new organism.

    **Types of Development:**
        1. **Oviparous:** Organisms that lay eggs, such as birds and reptiles.
        2. **Viviparous:** Organisms that give birth to young ones directly, such as mammals (humans, dogs).


**Advantages and Disadvantages of Sexual Reproduction:**

**Advantages:**

* Genetic variation increases the adaptability of organisms.
* Development of new traits.
* More suitable traits are passed on due to natural selection.

**Disadvantages:**

* This process is time-consuming.
* The rate of offspring production is low.
* Requires two parents.


# Human Reproduction

**Introduction:** Humans reproduce sexually, involving both male and female parents. It's a complex biological process including gamete formation, fertilization, embryonic development, and birth.


# Human Reproductive System

**(A) Male Reproductive System:** This system is responsible for sperm production and transfer.  Main parts:

1. **Testes:** Produce sperm and testosterone.
2. **Scrotum:**  Keeps testes at an optimal temperature.
3. **Epididymis:** Stores and matures sperm.
4. **Vas Deferens:** Conducts sperm outwards.
5. **Accessory Glands:**
    * Prostate Gland
    * Cowper's Gland
    * Seminal Vesicles: Produce semen, nourishing and enabling sperm motility.
6. **Penis:** Transfers sperm into the female reproductive system.


**(B) Female Reproductive System:** This system is responsible for ovum production, fertilization, and embryo development. Main parts:

1. **Ovaries:** Produce ova and female hormones (estrogen, progesterone).
2. **Fallopian Tubes:** Transport ova to the uterus; fertilization occurs here.
3. **Uterus:**  Provides a suitable environment for zygote development.
4. **Cervix:** Connects the uterus and vagina.
5. **Vagina:**  Used for copulation and childbirth.


# Process of Human Reproduction

**(A) Gametogenesis:** Formation of gametes:

* **Spermatogenesis:** Sperm formation in the testes.
* **Oogenesis:** Ovum formation in the ovaries.

**(B) Fertilization:** Fusion of sperm and ovum.

* Sperm and ovum meet in the fallopian tube to form a zygote.

**(C) Embryonic Development:**

1. The zygote divides and forms an embryo.
2. The embryo implants in the uterine wall.
3. **Gestation Period:** The embryo develops in the uterus for 9 months.

**(D) Parturition:** Birth of the baby.

* When the fetus is fully developed, it is born through the labor process.


# Reproductive Hormones in Humans

| Hormone             | Source             | Function                                                                        |

| Hormone | Gland | Function |
|---|---|---|
| Estrogen | Ovaries | Development of female characteristics and menstrual cycle; helps maintain pregnancy. |
| Progesterone | Ovaries | Helps maintain pregnancy. |


**Menstrual Cycle**

The menstrual cycle in females is approximately 28 days long and has four phases:

1.  **Menstrual Phase** (1-5 days) – The uterine lining (endometrium) is shed.
2.  **Follicular Phase** (6-14 days) – The ovum develops, and estrogen is secreted.
3.  **Ovulation Phase** (14th day) – The ovum is released from the ovary.
4.  **Luteal Phase** (15-28 days) – Progesterone prepares the uterus for implantation of a fertilized ovum.


**Contraception**

Contraception refers to methods used to prevent unwanted pregnancy. It is mainly divided into four types:

1.  **Natural Methods**
    *   Safe period method – Intercourse during the safe days of the menstrual cycle.
    *   Withdrawal method – Withdrawing the penis before ejaculation.

2.  **Barrier Methods**
    *   Condoms – For both men and women; also protects against STDs.
    *   Diaphragms and contraceptive caps – Prevent sperm from entering the uterus.
    *   Spermicides – Chemicals that kill sperm; safe and hormone-free.

3.  **Hormonal Methods**
    *   Contraceptive pills – Prevent ovulation; 91-99% effective.
    *   Contraceptive injections – Effective for up to 3 months.
    *   Contraceptive implants and patches – Long-term effective hormonal methods; may have hormonal side effects.

4.  **Permanent Methods**
    *   Vasectomy (for men) – Permanently blocks sperm flow.
    *   Tubectomy (for women) – Prevents the ovum from reaching the uterus.


**Chapter 4: Excretion in Organisms**

Excretion is the process by which organisms remove toxic and unusable waste products from their bodies. This process is essential for all living beings because accumulated waste products can be harmful.


**Excretion in Different Types of Organisms**

1.  **Excretion in Unicellular Organisms**
    *   Organisms like amoeba and paramecium excrete through simple diffusion.
    *   They release gases and waste products directly into the external environment.
    *   Amoeba expels water and other waste products through the contractile vacuole.

2.  **Excretion in Multicellular Organisms**
    *   **(a) Excretion in Plants:** Plants excrete waste products through leaf fall, stomata, and resin. Some gases (like oxygen and carbon dioxide) are released through leaves. Substances like gums, resins, and latex are also excreted.
    *   **(b) Excretion in Animals:**


# Page 2




General Science and Technology Pg No. 78

Sponges and coelenterates (like hydra) excrete through diffusion.
Roundworms and insects (like earthworms) – excrete waste products through structures called nephridia.
Insects (like cockroaches) – have Malpighian tubules that excrete waste.
Fish and amphibians (like frogs) – excrete ammonia, urea, and other nitrogenous substances.
Reptiles, birds, and mammals (like humans) – have a developed excretory system where the kidneys play a major role.


**Excretory System in Humans**

The excretory system removes waste products from the body. This system mainly consists of the kidneys and their accessory organs.

1.  **Main Organs of the Excretory System**

    **(i) Kidneys**
        *   Humans have two kidneys located below the ribs, on either side of the spine.
        *   They are the main excretory organs, filtering blood and removing waste products (like urea, ammonia, uric acid).
        *   Each kidney contains microscopic structures called nephrons, which are the units of blood purification.
        *   **Functions of Nephrons:**
            1.  Glomerular filtration – Filtering waste from the blood.
            2.  Reabsorption – Reabsorbing useful substances (like water, glucose, salts).
            3.  Tubular secretion – Removing excess ions and toxic substances.

    **(ii) Ureters**
        *   Ureters are two thin tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder.
        *   Urine flow is due to gravity and muscle contractions.

    **(iii) Urinary Bladder**
        *   It is a sac-like structure where urine is stored.
        *   It is made of muscular tissue and temporarily stores urine.
        *   When the bladder is full, it initiates the process of urination (micturition).

    **(iv) Urethra**
        *   It is the passage that carries urine from the bladder out of the body.
        *   The length of the urethra differs in males and females:
            *   Males have a longer urethra, which is also connected to the reproductive system.
            *   Females have a shorter urethra, and it only functions for urination.

2.  **Accessory Excretory Organs**

    Some other organs also help in removing waste products:

    **(i) Skin**
        *   Excretes water, salts, and urea in the form of sweat.
        *   It also helps regulate body temperature.

    **(ii) Lungs**
        *   Excrete carbon dioxide and water vapor.
        *   They help in the excretion of gaseous waste products.

    **(iii) Liver**
        *   Converts ammonia to urea and releases it into the blood, which is then excreted by the kidneys as urine.
        *   Excretes excess hormones, drugs, and toxic substances.

3.  **Process of Excretion**



**4. Diseases related to the excretory system**

*   Kidney stones - due to the deposition of minerals.
*   Kidney failure - when the kidneys are unable to purify the blood, dialysis is required.
*   Uremia - excessive increase in the amount of urea in the blood.
*   Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) - due to bacterial infection.

**5. Dialysis**

*   When the kidneys stop working, the dialysis machine helps remove waste products from the blood.
*   It is an artificial excretion process that temporarily performs the function of the kidneys.

**Ch-5 Respiration in Organisms**

Respiration is the process in which organisms convert food (glucose) into energy using oxygen and remove waste products in the form of carbon dioxide and water. This energy is essential for all biological functions of organisms.

**1. Types of Respiration**

**(i) Aerobic Respiration**

*   This respiration occurs in the presence of oxygen.
*   In this, glucose is completely broken down to produce energy (ATP), carbon dioxide, and water.
*   This takes place inside the mitochondria of cells.

Equation: C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Energy (ATP)

Examples: Humans, mammals, birds, amphibians, most plants, and other higher-order organisms.

**(ii) Anaerobic Respiration**

*   This respiration occurs in the absence of oxygen.
*   In this, glucose is not completely broken down, producing a small amount of energy.
*   Its byproducts can be ethanol, lactic acid, or other organic compounds.

Equation (in yeast): C₆H₁₂O₆ → 2C₂H₅OH + 2CO₂ + Energy (small amount of ATP)

Equation (in human muscles, when there is a lack of oxygen): C₆H₁₂O₆ → 2C₃H₆O₃ + Energy (small amount of ATP)

Examples: Yeast and some bacteria are useful in the process of making alcohol and yogurt. Human muscles - when excessive exercise leads to a lack of oxygen, lactic acid starts to form, causing fatigue and cramps.

**Respiratory System in Different Organisms**

**(i) Respiration in Unicellular Organisms**

*   Organisms like Amoeba and Paramecium exchange gases through diffusion.
*   They directly absorb oxygen from water or air and expel carbon dioxide.

**(ii) Respiration in Aquatic Animals**

*   Fish, tadpoles of frogs, shrimp, and some other aquatic organisms have gills that absorb oxygen dissolved in water.
*   Gills exchange oxygen in the blood and expel carbon dioxide.

**(iii) Respiration in Terrestrial Animals**

**(a) In Insects**

*   Cockroaches, grasshoppers, and other insects have tracheal systems.
*   They absorb oxygen through small pores (spiracles) and deliver it to the cells through tracheoles.

**(b) In Earthworms**

*   Earthworms respire through their skin.
*   Their skin maintains moisture, allowing gas exchange through diffusion.

**(c) In Amphibians**

*   Frogs respire through their skin, lungs, and mouth.
*   In water - through skin
*   On land - through lungs and skin

**(d) In Reptiles, Birds, and Mammals**

*   Snakes, lizards, pigeons, dogs, cats, and humans respire through lungs.
*   These organisms absorb oxygen from the atmosphere and expel carbon dioxide.

**Respiratory System in Humans**

The respiratory system is the biological system that absorbs oxygen into the body and expels carbon dioxide. This process is necessary for organisms to obtain energy.

**Major Organs of the Respiratory System**

**(i) Nose**

*   The nose is the first part of the respiratory system, through which air enters the body.
*   It contains small hairs and mucus that trap dust, dirt, and germs.
*   The nasal cavity inside the nose moistens and warms the air, allowing clean air to reach the lungs.

**(ii) Pharynx**

*   This is the structure that connects the nose and trachea.
*   It has a flap called the epiglottis that separates the passage of food and air so that food does not go down the wrong way.

**(iii) Trachea**

*   It is also called the windpipe.
*   It is about 10-12 cm long tube that carries air to the lungs.
*   The trachea has a C-shaped cartilaginous ring structure that keeps it flexible and open.
*   The cilia and mucus inside it help remove harmful particles and dust.

**(iv) Bronchi and Bronchioles**

*   The trachea is divided into two branches called bronchi.
*   Each bronchus enters the lungs and divides into small tubes (bronchioles).
*   Bronchioles eventually connect to the alveoli, where gas exchange takes place.

**(v) Lungs**

*   Humans have two lungs located in the thoracic cavity.
*   The right lung is divided into three lobes and the left lung into two lobes.
*   Each lung contains millions of alveoli, whose walls are thin and surrounded by capillaries.
*   Gas exchange takes place in the alveoli - Oxygen enters the blood. Carbon dioxide leaves the blood and is expelled.

**(vi) Diaphragm**

*   It is a dome-shaped muscle that controls the breathing process.



**(vi) Diaphragm**

*   It is a dome-shaped muscle that controls the breathing process.


**(vii) Process of Respiration in Humans**

**(i) Inhalation**

*   Air enters through the nose.
*   It is purified and reaches the lungs through the trachea.
*   Oxygen in the alveoli mixes with the blood.


**(ii) Gas Exchange**

*   Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place in the alveoli present in the lungs.
*   Oxygen enters the blood, and hemoglobin carries it to different parts of the body.
*   Carbon dioxide enters the alveoli from the blood and gets ready to exit.


**(iii) Exhalation**

*   The diaphragm moves upward.
*   The lungs contract, and air containing carbon dioxide is expelled.


**(viii) Types of Respiration in Humans**

**(i) External Respiration**

*   This process occurs in the lungs, where oxygen enters the blood, and carbon dioxide is expelled.


**(ii) Internal Respiration**

*   This process occurs in the body cells, where blood delivers oxygen to the cells, and the cells release carbon dioxide after energy production.


**(iii) Cellular Respiration**

*   This is a biochemical process that takes place in mitochondria, where glucose breaks down in the presence of oxygen to produce energy (ATP).
*   The equation is as follows: C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Energy (ATP)


**(ix) Diseases Related to the Respiratory System**

| Disease             | Cause                               | Symptoms                                                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Asthma               | Inflammation in respiratory tracts     | Difficulty in breathing, wheezing, chest tightness                           |
| Pneumonia            | Bacterial or viral infection            | Fever, cough, chest pain, difficulty in breathing                           |
| Bronchitis           | Inflammation of air passages          | Cough, sore throat, phlegm                                                  |
| Tuberculosis (TB)    | Bacterial infection (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) | Prolonged cough, fever, weight loss                                        |
| Silicosis             | Dust and silica inhalation             | Irritation in lungs, cough, shortness of breath                            |
| COPD                 | Smoking and pollution                 | Persistent cough, phlegm, difficulty in breathing                           |


**(x) Tips for a Healthy Respiratory System**

1. Avoid smoking – it damages the lungs.
2. Avoid pollution – wear a mask and stay in clean air.
3. Regular exercise – increases breathing capacity.
4. Stay hydrated – drinking enough water keeps mucus clean.
5. Balanced diet – green vegetables and fruits strengthen the lungs.


**(xi) Circulation in Organisms**

Circulation is the biological process by which organisms transport oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and other essential substances throughout their bodies and remove waste products. This process is crucial for the survival and proper functioning of organisms.

**(xii) Types of Circulation**

**(i) Open Circulatory System**

*   This type of circulation does not have a complete network of blood vessels.
*   Blood is pumped from the heart into an open cavity (hemocoel) and directly bathes the organs.
*   There is no clear separation between blood and interstitial fluid.
*   Examples: Insects (cockroaches, grasshoppers), mollusks (snails).


**(ii) Closed Circulatory System**

*   In this system, blood travels from the heart to different parts of the body through vessels (arteries, veins, capillaries).
*   Circulation is more efficient and faster in this system.
*   Examples: Humans, amphibians (frogs), birds, fish, mammals.


**(xiii) Circulatory System in Different Organisms**

**(i) Circulation in Unicellular Organisms**

*   Organisms like amoeba and paramecium do not have a specific circulatory system.
*   They exchange oxygen, nutrients, and waste products through diffusion.


**(ii) Circulation in Aquatic Animals**

*   Fish have single circulation, where the heart pumps blood only once.
*   Blood goes from the heart to the gills, where it takes up oxygen and then flows to the body.
*   Amphibians (frogs) have double but incomplete circulation, where oxygenated and deoxygenated blood mix to some extent.


**(xiv) Circulation in Insects**

*   Insects have an open circulatory system.
*   Heart contractions cause blood to flow into the hemocoel and bathe the body organs.
*   Blood does not transport oxygen as it lacks hemoglobin; gas transport is done by the tracheal system.


**(xv) Circulation in Amphibians & Reptiles**

*   Frogs have a three-chambered heart with two atria and one ventricle.
*   They have incomplete double circulation, where oxygenated and deoxygenated blood mix to some extent.
*   Reptiles (snakes, lizards) also have a three-chambered heart, but crocodiles have a four-chambered heart.


**(xvi) Circulation in Birds & Mammals**

*   Birds and mammals (including humans) have a four-chambered heart.
*   Their circulation is complete and double.
*   The heart pumps blood twice –
    1. Deoxygenated blood from the body goes to the lungs.
    2. Oxygenated blood from the lungs returns to the heart and flows to various body parts.





# Circulation in Birds & Mammals (Continued)

**(xvi) Circulation in Birds & Mammals**

*   Birds and mammals (including humans) have a four-chambered heart.
*   Their circulation is complete and double.
*   The heart pumps blood twice –
    1. Deoxygenated blood from the body goes to the lungs.
    2. Oxygenated blood from the lungs returns to the heart and flows to various body parts.


**(Circulatory System in Humans)**

*   The circulatory system in humans transports oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and waste products to all parts of the body.  This system is mainly composed of the heart, blood, and blood vessels.


**(Main Components of the Circulatory System)**

**(i) Heart**

*   The human heart is a four-chambered muscular organ that pumps blood throughout the body. It is located slightly to the left of the center in the thoracic cavity. The heart is the center of the body's circulatory system and plays a vital role in life.


**(Structure of the Human Heart)**

**(i) Layers of the Heart**

The heart wall is made up of three layers:

1.  **Endocardium:** This is the innermost layer and keeps the inner surface of the heart smooth.
2.  **Myocardium:** This is the muscular layer of the heart, which helps the heart contract and expand.
3.  **Pericardium:** This is the outer protective membrane that surrounds the heart, protecting it and reducing friction.


**(ii) Chambers of the Heart**

The heart is divided into four chambers:

| Chamber Name          | Function                                                              |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Right Atrium            | Receives deoxygenated blood from the body.                           |
| Right Ventricle         | Pumps this blood to the lungs.                                        |
| Left Atrium             | Receives oxygenated blood from the lungs.                             |
| Left Ventricle          | Pumps this blood to the entire body.                                  |

**Important Points:**

*   The left ventricle is the strongest part of the heart because it has to send blood throughout the body.
*   A thick muscular wall (Interventricular Septum) separates the left and right sides of the heart.


**(iii) Valves of the Heart**

The heart has four valves that maintain unidirectional blood flow and prevent backflow:

| Valve Name            | Location                                                              | Function                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tricuspid Valve        | Between the right atrium and right ventricle.                        | Regulates blood flow between the right atrium and right ventricle.          |
| Mitral Valve/Bicuspid Valve | Between the left atrium and left ventricle.                           | Regulates blood flow between the left atrium and left ventricle.            |
| Aortic Valve           | Between the left ventricle and the aorta.                             | Regulates blood flow from the left ventricle to the body.                    |
| Pulmonary Valve        | Between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery.                 | Regulates blood flow from the right ventricle to the lungs.                   |


**(Functioning of the Heart)**

**(i) Blood Circulation in the Heart**

The heart performs two types of circulation:

1.  **Pulmonary Circulation:** Deoxygenated blood enters the right atrium and goes into the right ventricle. The right ventricle sends this blood to the lungs through the pulmonary artery, where it picks up oxygen.
2.  **Systemic Circulation:** Oxygenated blood returns from the lungs to the left atrium. This blood enters the left ventricle, which sends it throughout the body via the aorta.  Thus, the heart pumps blood to deliver oxygen and nutrients to all parts of the body.


**(ii) Heartbeat and Conduction System**

*   The heartbeat is controlled by the sinoatrial node (SA Node), also called the natural pacemaker.
*   The heart beats at a rate of 72 times per minute.
*   Electrical signals from the SA node travel through the atrioventricular node (AV Node), bundle of His, and Purkinje fibers to the heart muscles, causing the heart to beat.


**(Heart Diseases)**

| Disease           | Cause                                                        | Symptoms                                                     |

**(Tips for a Healthy Heart)**

1.  Eat a healthy diet – Include green vegetables, fruits, and low-fat foods.
2.  Exercise regularly – Engage in 30 minutes of physical activity daily.
3.  Avoid smoking and alcohol – These harm the heart.
4.  Reduce stress – Practice yoga and meditation.
5.  Drink enough water – To maintain smooth blood circulation.
6.  Get regular health checkups – To prevent heart disease, check blood pressure and cholesterol regularly.


**(Blood)**

Blood is the fluid tissue of the body that transports various substances.


**(Components of Blood)**

| Component         | Function                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Red Blood Cells (RBCs) | Transport oxygen (red color due to hemoglobin)                            |
| White Blood Cells (WBCs) | Protect against diseases (part of the immune system)                       |
| Platelets           | Blood clotting (help in wound healing)                                   |
| Plasma             | Transports nutrients, hormones, and waste products                        |


**(Blood Vessels)**

Blood vessels are the tubes that carry blood from the heart to different parts of the body and back to the heart.

| Type              | Function                                                                 | Characteristics                                                       |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Arteries          | Carry oxygenated blood from the heart to the body.                        | Thick-walled, capable of withstanding high blood pressure           |
| Veins              | Carry deoxygenated blood from the body back to the heart.                 | Thin-walled, have valves that prevent backflow of blood             |
| Capillaries        | Exchange of oxygen and nutrients to cells.                               | Very thin-walled, microscopic blood vessels                         |





## Types of Circulation in Humans

**(i) Pulmonary Circulation:**

* Occurs between the heart and lungs.
* Deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle goes to the lungs, where it takes up oxygen.
* Oxygenated blood returns from the lungs to the left atrium.

**(ii) Systemic Circulation:**

* Relates to the circulation of blood from the heart throughout the body.
* Oxygenated blood from the left ventricle goes throughout the body via arteries.
* After the body uses oxygen, blood returns to the right atrium via veins.

**(iii) Portal Circulation:**

* Controls the flow of blood between the liver and intestines.
* Nutrients absorbed from the intestines first go to the liver, then are distributed to other parts of the body.


## Process of Circulation in Humans

1. **Flow of oxygenated blood from the heart:**  From the left ventricle to various parts of the body via the aorta.
2. **Distribution of oxygen and nutrients in the body:** Exchange of gases and nutrients in capillaries.
3. **Return of deoxygenated blood:** Blood from the body comes to the right atrium of the heart through veins.
4. **Oxygen uptake in the lungs:** Blood from the right ventricle goes to the lungs, takes up oxygen, and returns to the left atrium.
5. **Recirculation of blood:** This cycle continues constantly.


## Heartbeat and Blood Pressure

**(i) Heartbeat:**

* The normal heartbeat rate is 72 beats per minute.
* The heartbeat is controlled by the sinoatrial node (SA Node), which is called the natural pacemaker of the heart.

**(ii) Blood Pressure:**

* Blood pressure is the force with which blood exerts pressure on the walls of arteries.
* It is measured as systolic and diastolic pressure:
    * Systolic Pressure (when the heart contracts, normal: 120 mmHg)
    * Diastolic Pressure (when the heart relaxes, normal: 80 mmHg)
* Measured using a sphygmomanometer.

## Tips for a Healthy Circulatory System

1. Eat a healthy diet – green vegetables, fruits, and low-fat foods.
2. Exercise regularly – strengthens the heart.
3. Avoid smoking and alcohol – have bad effects on the circulatory system.
4. Reduce stress – excess stress can increase blood pressure.
5. Drink enough water – keeps blood circulation smooth.


## Digestive System in Organisms

The function of the digestive system is to break down food into smaller molecules that can be absorbed by the body. The structure and function of the digestive system vary in different organisms depending on their diet and body structure.


## Types of Digestive Systems

**(a) Incomplete Digestive System:**

* Has only one opening (mouth) through which food is ingested and waste is expelled.
* Example: Hydra, Planaria

**(b) Complete Digestive System:**

* Has two openings (mouth and anus), making ingestion and waste disposal separate.
* Example: Humans, cows, frogs, birds, insects, etc.


## Digestive Systems in Different Organisms

**(a) Digestion in Simple Organisms:**

**Amoeba:**

* It is a unicellular organism.
* It engulfs food by forming pseudopodia (false feet) around it.
* Food is taken inside and its enzymes digest it.

**Planaria and Hydra:**

* Planaria has a pipe-like structure that is used for both food intake and waste disposal.
* In Hydra, food is caught with tentacles and digestion takes place in the gastrovascular cavity.

**(b) Digestion in Complex Organisms:**

**1. Ruminants (Cows, buffaloes, goats, etc.):**

* Their stomach is divided into four parts:
    * Rumen – food is softened and fermentation occurs here.
    * Reticulum – food is brought back to the mouth for chewing.
    * Omasum – excess water is absorbed here.
    * Abomasum – actual digestion with enzymes takes place.


## Digestive System in Humans

The digestive system in humans is a complex system that converts food into simple substances, providing energy. This system is mainly composed of the alimentary canal and accessory glands.


## Main Parts of the Digestive System

**(a) Alimentary Canal in Humans:**

* The alimentary canal is a long, tube-like structure that carries out the functions of food intake, digestion, nutrient absorption, and waste disposal.
* Length: The total length of the alimentary canal in humans is approximately 8-10 meters.

**Main parts of the human alimentary canal:**

1. **Mouth & Buccal Cavity:**
    * Performs the function of ingestion (taking in food).
    * Teeth: Help in chewing food.





## Main Parts of the Digestive System (Continued)

1. **Tongue:** Helps in mixing, tasting, and swallowing food.
2. **Salivary Glands:** Secrete saliva containing the enzyme salivary amylase, which converts starch into maltose.
3. **Pharynx:** The region between the buccal cavity and the esophagus. It pushes food towards the esophagus.  Swallowing begins here.
4. **Esophagus:** A 25 cm long tube that carries food to the stomach. No digestion occurs here. The process of pushing food down is called peristalsis.
5. **Stomach:** A J-shaped sac located in the left part of the abdomen.  It secretes HCl (hydrochloric acid), which sterilizes food.  The enzyme pepsin breaks down proteins into smaller molecules. Rennin aids in digesting milk in children.
6. **Small Intestine:** 6-7 meters long. Divided into three parts:
    * **Duodenum:** Bile from the liver and enzymes from the pancreas enter here.
    * **Jejunum:** Digestion of nutrients occurs here.
    * **Ileum:** Absorption of nutrients occurs here.  It contains small finger-like projections called villi that absorb nutrients.
7. **Large Intestine:** Approximately 1.5 meters long.  Absorption of water and minerals occurs here. It includes the colon and rectum. Waste products are sent towards the anus.
8. **Anus:** The final part of the digestive system. Egestion (elimination of waste) takes place here.  Anal sphincter muscles control elimination.


## Accessory Digestive Glands in Humans

Accessory digestive glands are glands that do not directly process food, but aid digestion through their secretions (enzymes and juices). These glands help break down food into smaller molecules, making them absorbable.

**Main Accessory Digestive Glands:**

1. **Salivary Glands:** Located in the buccal cavity, they produce saliva. There are three types in humans:
    * Parotid gland (largest salivary gland, located near the ear)
    * Sublingual gland (located under the tongue)
    * Submandibular gland (located under the jaw)
    * **Main secretion:** Salivary amylase (converts starch (carbohydrate) to maltose). Saliva also moistens food and aids in chewing.

2. **Liver:** The largest gland in the human body, weighing approximately 1.5 kg. Located on the right side of the stomach.  Its main function is described in the next section (presumably).






## Page 1



**General Science and Technology**

**Bile Juice Production:** It breaks down fats into smaller globules (emulsification) so that enzymes can easily digest them. Bile juice is stored in the gallbladder (Gallbladder) from the liver and released into the small intestine as needed.

*   Eliminates toxins from the body (Detoxification).
*   Stores glucose by converting it into glycogen.

**3. Gallbladder**

*   It is a pear-shaped sac located below the liver.
*   Main function:
    *   Stores bile juice produced by the liver.
    *   Releases bile juice into the small intestine to digest the fats of food.
    *   Bile juice does not contain any digestive enzyme, but it helps in the breakdown of fat (Emulsification).

**4. Pancreas**

*   It is a mixed gland (Mixed Gland) located behind the stomach, which secretes both digestive enzymes and hormones.
*   Main secreted substances:
    1.  Pancreatic Juice: It contains three major enzymes:
        *   Trypsin - Breaks down protein into peptides.
        *   Lipase - Breaks down fat (Fat) into glycerol and fatty acids.
        *   Amylase - Converts starch into maltose.
    2.  Secretes insulin and glucagon hormones to regulate blood sugar levels.

**Process of Digestion in Humans**

Digestion is a complex biochemical process in which food is broken down into smaller molecules that can be absorbed by the body. This process takes place through mechanical and chemical digestion.

**Stages of the digestive process:**

**1. Ingestion:** Consumption of food

*   Food enters the oral cavity (Mouth), where teeth cut and chew it into small pieces.
*   Saliva moistens the food and helps in digestion.
*   An enzyme called tylin (Salivary Amylase) converts starch (Carbohydrate) into maltose (Maltose).
*   The tongue (Tongue) helps in turning and swallowing (Swallowing) the food.

**2. Propulsion:** Moving food through the digestive tract

*   Food passes through the pharynx (Pharynx) and enters the esophagus (Esophagus).
*   Peristalsis (Peristalsis): The muscles of the esophagus contract and expand, pushing the food towards the stomach.

**3. Mechanical & Chemical Digestion**

**(a) Digestion in the stomach (Stomach)**

*   Food stays in the stomach for 3-4 hours.
*   The stomach walls secrete gastric juice (Gastric Juice), which contains:
    *   HCl (Hydrochloric acid) - Makes food acidic, kills bacteria and activates pepsin.
    *   Pepsin (Pepsin) breaks down protein into small molecules (Peptides).
    *   Rennin (Rennin) helps in the digestion of milk (mainly active in children).

**(b) Digestion in the small intestine**

*   Food from the stomach enters the duodenum (Duodenum) of the small intestine.


## Page 2

**General Science and Technology**

Here, digestive enzymes are released by the liver (Liver), gallbladder (Gallbladder), and pancreas (Pancreas).

Which juices and enzymes work in the small intestine?

| Secretion             | Source      | Function                                                                       |
| :---------------------- | :----------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bile Juice             | Liver        | Emulsifies fat (breaks it into small pieces).                               |
| Pancreatic Juice       | Pancreas     | Contains three main enzymes:                                                  |
|                         |             | - Trypsin: Breaks down proteins into smaller molecules.                     |
|                         |             | - Lipase: Breaks down fats into glycerol and fatty acids.                   |
|                         |             | - Amylase: Converts carbohydrates into maltose.                             |
| Intestinal Juice       | Small Intestine | Contains enzymes that complete the final stages of digestion.                |

**4. Absorption:** Absorption of nutrients into the blood

*   The walls of the small intestine have finger-like structures called "villi (Villi)", which absorb nutrients.
*   Absorbed nutrients are transported to different parts of the body through the bloodstream (Bloodstream).
*   Glucose, amino acids, and water-soluble vitamins are absorbed into the blood.
*   Fats (Fatty Acids & Glycerol) are absorbed into the lymphatic system (Lymphatic System).

**5. Water Absorption and Waste Elimination (Water Absorption & Egestion)**

**(a) Water absorption in the large intestine (Large Intestine)**

*   Water and minerals (Minerals) are absorbed in the large intestine.
*   The remaining waste becomes thick and takes the form of feces (Feces).

**(b) Waste elimination from the anus (Anus)**

*   Waste is stored in the rectum (Rectum).
*   Waste is expelled (Egestion) from the anus (Anus).
*   This process is called defecation (Defecation).


**Digestive Enzymes and Their Role in the Human Body**

Digestive enzymes are biochemical substances that break down food into smaller, absorbable molecules. These enzymes work in different parts of the digestive system and specifically help in digesting carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and nucleic acids.

**1. Digestive Enzymes in the Oral Cavity (Mouth)**

The salivary glands in the oral cavity secrete saliva (Saliva), which contains an enzyme called tylin (Salivary Amylase).

*   Role: It converts starch (Carbohydrate) into maltose (Maltose).  For example, if we chew rice for a longer time, it starts to taste sweet because the starch in it starts to convert into maltose.

**2. Digestive Enzymes in the Stomach (Stomach)**

Gastric glands in the stomach secrete gastric juice, which contains three main enzymes.

*   Pepsin: It breaks down proteins into peptides. It is activated by HCl.





## Digestive Enzymes in the Small Intestine (Small Intestine)

Digestive enzymes in the small intestine come from three main sources: the pancreas, the gallbladder, and the small intestine itself.

**(a) Enzymes Secreted by the Pancreas (Pancreas)**

The pancreas releases pancreatic juice, which contains the following major enzymes:

*   Trypsin: It breaks down proteins and peptides into smaller amino acids.
*   Lipase: It breaks down fats into glycerol and fatty acids.
*   Amylase: It converts carbohydrates into maltose.

**(b) Enzymes Secreted by the Small Intestinal Wall**

The cells of the small intestine secrete intestinal juice, which contains enzymes that complete the final stages of digestion:

*   Maltase: It converts maltose into glucose.
*   Sucrase: It converts sucrose (table sugar) into glucose and fructose.
*   Lactase: It converts lactose (sugar present in milk) into glucose and galactose.
*   Peptidase: It converts small peptides into amino acids.

## Digestive Enzymes in the Large Intestine (Large Intestine)

No specific enzymes are found in the large intestine.  Here, only water and minerals are absorbed, while the remaining waste is expelled as feces.

## Blood Groups, Blood Composition, and Function

**Definition:**

A blood group is a classification system that divides blood into different types. This division is based on the antigens present on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs) and the antibodies present in the plasma.

**ABO Blood Group System**

This is the most important blood group system, discovered by Karl Landsteiner in 1901. It includes four types of blood groups:

*   Blood Group A: Contains A antigen on RBCs and B antibody in plasma.
*   Blood Group B: Contains B antigen on RBCs and A antibody in plasma.
*   Blood Group AB: Contains both A and B antigens on RBCs, but no antibodies in plasma.  This is the universal recipient.
*   Blood Group O: Contains no antigens on RBCs, but both A and B antibodies in plasma. This is the universal donor.

**Rh Factor (Rh Factor)**

*   The Rh factor is a type of protein (D antigen) found on the surface of RBCs.
*   If this protein is present in a person's blood, they are called Rh+ (positive).
*   If this protein is absent, they are called Rh- (negative).
*   If a person with Rh- blood group receives Rh+ blood, antibodies start to form, which can cause problems.

**Composition of Blood**

Blood is a liquid connective tissue that carries oxygen and nutrients to different parts of the body. It is mainly composed of plasma and cells.

1.  **Plasma:**
    *   It is the liquid part of blood (55%).
    *   It contains 90% water, proteins, salts, hormones, gases (O2, CO2), and waste products.
    *   It contains proteins called fibrinogen and prothrombin, which help in blood clot formation.

2.  **Blood Cells:**  There are three types of cells found in blood:

    **(a) Red Blood Cells (RBCs – Red Blood Cells / Erythrocytes):**
    *   Also called red blood corpuscles.
    *   They carry oxygen throughout the body.
    *   They contain a protein called hemoglobin, which binds and transports oxygen and carbon dioxide.
    *   They are formed in bone marrow and have a lifespan of 120 days.

    **(b) White Blood Cells (WBCs – White Blood Cells / Leukocytes):**
    *   They are part of the immune system.
    *   They protect the body from infection.
    *   Their lifespan is 12-20 days.
    *   Types of WBCs:
        *   Neutrophils: Protect against bacteria and fungi.
        *   Lymphocytes: Produce antibodies.
        *   Monocytes: Help eliminate infections.
        *   Eosinophils: Protect against allergies and parasitic infections.
        *   Basophils: Help in inflammation and allergic reactions.

    **(c) Platelets (Platelets – Thrombocytes):**
    *   They help in blood clotting.
    *   Their lifespan is 8-10 days.
    *   If the number of platelets in the body is low, bleeding increases.

**Functions of Blood:**

1.  **Transportation of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide:** Hemoglobin in RBCs carries oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body and carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs.
2.  **Transportation of Nutrients:** Blood carries glucose, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals from food to the body's cells.
3.  **Immunity:** WBCs protect the body from bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. Lymphocytes produce antibodies to protect the body from infections.
4.  **Blood Clotting:** Platelets and fibrinogen help stop bleeding when injured.
5.  **Regulation of Body Temperature:** Blood distributes heat throughout the body, maintaining a balanced body temperature.
6.  **Transportation of Hormones and Enzymes:** Blood carries hormones from endocrine glands to various parts of the body.
7.  **Excretion:** Blood carries unwanted substances (such as urea and carbon dioxide) to the kidneys and lungs, where they are expelled from the body.



# Hormones

Hormones are chemical messengers secreted by endocrine glands.  They travel through the bloodstream to various parts of the body, controlling and regulating bodily functions.

**Key Characteristics:**

1. Hormones are secreted directly into the bloodstream.
2. They regulate body growth, development, metabolism, reproduction, and other functions.
3. Excess (hypersecretion) or deficiency (hyposecretion) of hormones can lead to various diseases.


**Main Hormones and Their Glands:**

1. **Pituitary Gland (Master Gland):** Located beneath the brain, it controls other glands.
    * **Growth Hormone (GH):** Controls body growth.
        * Excess → Gigantism

## Difference between Endemic, Epidemic and Pandemic

**1. Endemic (Endemic):** A disease that is constantly present in a particular region, country or community at an expected level.  It is common in that area and affects people from time to time, but does not spread on a large scale.  Example: Malaria in some tropical regions.

**2. Epidemic (Epidemic):** When a disease affects more people in a particular region, country or community than usual, rapidly. It increases suddenly and can infect a large number of people at the local or national level. Example: The Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014.

**3. Pandemic (Pandemic):** When a disease spreads to many countries or continents and affects a large number of people globally. It is a widespread and serious level of infection. Example: COVID-19, which affected the whole world in 2020.


## COVID-19

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This virus was first found in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and then quickly spread throughout the world.

### Why did COVID-19 become a pandemic?

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020 because:

1.  It was a rapidly spreading disease.
2.  It had spread to almost all countries in the world.
3.  It had a serious impact, resulting in the loss of millions of lives and putting immense pressure on healthcare systems.

### Main Symptoms of COVID-19:

*   Cough
*   Difficulty breathing
*   Sore throat
*   Loss of taste and smell
*   Fatigue
*   In some cases, stomach problems and skin rashes

### How it Spreads:

*   Through droplets released from an infected person's cough, sneeze, or talk.
*   By touching an infected surface and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes.
*   Through the air (especially in crowded places).

### Prevention Measures:

*   Wearing a mask
*   Washing hands (for at least 20 seconds)
*   Avoiding crowded places
*   Getting vaccinated
*   Maintaining physical distance

### Vaccination and Treatment:

Several vaccines were developed for COVID-19, including Covaxin, Covishield, Pfizer, Moderna and Sputnik V.  In addition, antiviral drugs and oxygen therapy were used for treatment.

## Immunization and Vaccination (Immunization & Vaccination)

Immunization and vaccination are processes to strengthen the body's immune system to prevent infectious diseases.  It plays an important role in preventing infectious diseases, controlling infections, and preventing epidemics.

### What is Immunization?

Immunization is a biological process in which the immune system is trained to develop the ability to fight infection. This can be done naturally or artificially.

#### Types:

1.  **Active Immunization:** The body itself produces antibodies and immune cells. Examples: Vaccination, immunity developed after natural infection.
2.  **Passive Immunization:** Ready-made antibodies are directly injected into the body. Examples: Antibodies received from mother to child, antiserum injection.

### What is Vaccination?

Vaccination is the process of training the body's immune system against a particular disease using vaccines.

### What is a Vaccine?

A vaccine is a medicine or biological substance containing weakened or inactive germs, their toxins, or parts thereof. It increases immunity in the body.

#### Types of Vaccines:

1.  Live attenuated vaccines



## Types of Vaccines (Continued):

1.  **Live attenuated vaccines:** These vaccines contain weakened germs.  Examples: BCG, MMR, Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV).
2.  **Inactivated vaccines (Killed vaccines):** These vaccines contain dead germs. Examples: Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV), Rabies vaccine.
3.  **Toxoid vaccines:** These vaccines are made by inactivating toxins produced by bacteria. Examples: Tetanus, Diphtheria vaccine.
4.  **Subunit, Recombinant, Conjugate vaccines:** These contain parts of the germ that trigger an immune response. Examples: Hepatitis B, HPV vaccine.
5.  **mRNA vaccines:** These vaccines contain the virus's genetic material (mRNA), which trains the body to produce an immune response. Examples: Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for COVID-19.


### Importance of Vaccination:

*   **Prevention of infectious diseases:** Diseases like smallpox, polio, measles, and diphtheria have been controlled.

## Plant Parts and Their Functions (Chapter 15)

Plants are an essential part of our lives. They provide us with food, oxygen, and many other necessities. Plants have various parts, and each part has a specific function.


**Main Parts of a Plant:**

A plant is primarily composed of four main parts:

1.  Root
2.  Stem
3.  Leaf
4.  Flower


**Functions of Plant Parts:**

**(a) Function of the Root:**

*   Roots are the underground part, anchoring the plant in the soil.
*   They absorb water and minerals and transport them to the plant.
*   Some plant roots store food, such as carrots, radishes, and sweet potatoes.
*   They help prevent soil erosion.


**(b) Function of the Stem:**

*   The stem is the aerial part of the plant growing above the ground.
*   It supports the leaves, flowers, and fruits.
*   It transports nutrients and water from the roots to the leaves.
*   Some plant stems, like potatoes and ginger, store food.
*   The stem assists in asexual reproduction.


**(c) Function of the Leaf:**

*   Leaves are the most important part of the plant because they produce food through photosynthesis.





**(d) Function of the Flower:**

*   The flower is the reproductive organ of the plant.
*   It is necessary for the production of seeds and fruits in plants.
*   The flower has male and female parts that participate in the processes of pollination and fertilization.
*   The flower has four main parts: petals, sepals, pistil, and stamens.

**(e) Types of Nutrition in Plants:**

*   There are two types of nutrition found in plants: autotrophic nutrition and heterotrophic nutrition.
    *   **(A) Autotrophic Nutrition:** Plants that synthesize their own food are called autotrophs. These plants produce glucose from carbon dioxide and water through photosynthesis.  Their key characteristics are that they are green plants containing chlorophyll, they use the energy of sunlight to make food from carbon dioxide and water, and this process also produces oxygen gas (O2).
    *   **(B) Heterotrophic Nutrition:** Plants that cannot make their own food and depend on other organisms or decaying matter are called heterotrophic plants.  Heterotrophic plants are mainly of three types: parasitic plants, saprophytic plants, and insectivorous plants.

        *   **1. Parasitic Plants:** These plants depend on other plants for their nutrition. Examples include Cuscuta and Mistletoe.
        *   **2. Saprophytic Plants:** These plants obtain their nutrition from dead and decaying organisms. They are usually found in moist and dark places. Examples include mold and mushroom.
        *   **3. Insectivorous Plants:** These plants obtain their nutrition by trapping small insects because their soil lacks essential minerals. Examples include pitcher plant, Venus flytrap, and bladderwort.


**(f) Photosynthesis:**

*   Photosynthesis is the biochemical process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria use the energy of sunlight to produce carbohydrates (glucose) and oxygen (O2) from water (H₂O) and carbon dioxide (CO₂).

## Page 1: General Science and Technology

This process is crucial for sustaining life on Earth, as it supplies oxygen to the atmosphere and forms the base of the food chain.

**General Equation of Photosynthesis:**

6CO₂ + 6H₂O  →  C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

*   CO₂ (Carbon Dioxide) – obtained from the atmosphere.
*   H₂O (Water) – absorbed from the soil by roots.
*   Sunlight – provides energy.
*   Chlorophyll – green pigment present in leaves, which absorbs light energy.
*   C₆H₁₂O₆ (Glucose) – energy source for plants.
*   O₂ (Oxygen) – released as a byproduct.

**Stages of Photosynthesis:**

Photosynthesis is divided into two main stages:

**(A) Light Reaction:**

*   This process occurs in the presence of sunlight.
*   Light energy is converted into ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) and NADPH (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate).
*   Water (H₂O) is split in this stage, releasing oxygen (O₂).

**Main Events:**

1.  Light Absorption: Chlorophyll absorbs light energy.
2.  Photolysis: Water molecules are broken down, and oxygen is released.
3.  ATP and NADPH Formation: These two compounds provide energy for further reactions.

**(B) Dark Reaction / Calvin Cycle:**

*   This reaction can occur without the presence of light.
*   It takes place in the stroma of the chloroplast.
*   Atmospheric CO₂ is used to produce glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆).
*   ATP and NADPH are used in this process.

**Main Events:**

1.  Carbon Fixation: A molecule called Ribulose Biphosphate (RuBP) binds carbon dioxide.
2.  Glucose Formation: Carbohydrates are formed with the help of ATP and NADPH.
3.  Regeneration of RuBP: This step helps restart the Calvin cycle.

**Factors Affecting Photosynthesis:**

Photosynthesis depends on several internal and external factors.

**(A) External Factors:**

1.  Light Intensity: As light intensity increases, the rate of photosynthesis also increases.
2.  CO₂ Concentration: Higher CO₂ levels speed up photosynthesis.
3.  Water: Water shortage closes stomata, reducing CO₂ absorption.
4.  Temperature: Photosynthesis is most effective at an ideal temperature (25-30°C).
5.  Soil Nutrients: Magnesium (Mg) and Nitrogen (N) are essential for chlorophyll formation.

**(B) Internal Factors:**

1.  Chlorophyll Content: Higher chlorophyll levels result in more photosynthesis.
2.  Leaf Anatomy: Wide and thin leaves can absorb more light.


## Page 2: General Science and Technology

3. Stomatal Conductance: The flow of CO₂ through stomata affects photosynthesis.

**Importance of Photosynthesis:**

1.  Oxygen Production: This process supplies oxygen to the atmosphere.
2.  Food Production: It provides an energy source for all living beings on Earth.
3.  Carbon Dioxide Utilization: It absorbs CO₂ from the atmosphere, maintaining climate balance.
4.  Energy Storage: Converts solar energy into chemical energy.
5.  Maintaining Environmental Balance: Photosynthesis aids in balancing the ecosystem.

**Mineral Nutrition:**

Plants need various minerals for healthy growth and development, which they absorb from the soil.

**(A) Macronutrients:**

These elements are needed in large quantities by plants.

*   Nitrogen (N): Helps in leaf and protein formation.
*   Phosphorus (P): Essential for root and flower development.
*   Potassium (K): Aids in cell growth and enzyme activities.
*   Calcium (Ca): Strengthens the cell wall.
*   Magnesium (Mg): Aids in chlorophyll formation.
*   Sulfur (S): Helps in protein synthesis.

**(B) Micronutrients:**

These elements are needed in small amounts but are still crucial for plants.

*   Iron (Fe): Helps in chlorophyll formation.
*   Manganese (Mn): Aids in enzyme activities.
*   Zinc (Zn): Produces growth hormones.
*   Copper (Cu): Helps in protein formation.
*   Boron (B): Aids in cell division.
*   Molybdenum (Mo): Aids in the nitrogen cycle.

**Transportation of Water and Nutrients:**

Water and nutrients are transported in plants through two tissues:

1.  **Xylem:** Transports water and minerals from the roots to other parts of the plant. Water movement is facilitated by root pressure, capillary action, and transpiration pull.
2.  **Phloem:** Transports food made in the leaves to various parts of the plant. This process is called the source-sink hypothesis.

**Special Facts Related to Plant Nutrition:**

*   Stomata in leaves facilitate gas exchange.
*   Algae and cyanobacteria also perform photosynthesis.
*   Plants in swampy areas are carnivorous plants like pitcher plants because their soil lacks essential minerals.
*   Fungi and bacteria help some plants with nitrogen fixation, such as peanuts and soybeans.





# Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs)

Plant growth regulators are biochemical substances that control and coordinate plant growth, development, and differentiation in very small quantities. They are also called plant hormones.

**Types of Plant Growth Regulators:**

These are mainly of two types:

1.  **Stimulatory growth regulators:** These increase plant growth.
2.  **Inhibitory growth regulators:** These stop or control plant growth.


**Stimulatory Growth Regulators:**

These hormones help in the growth of plant length, branches, flowers, and fruits.

**(i) Auxins:**

*   Promote cell growth, division, and elongation in plants.
*   Control root and stem growth.
*   Inhibit lateral growth and promote apical dominance.
*   Uses: To artificially increase root development and fruit formation.
*   Examples: IAA (Indole-3-Acetic Acid), IBA (Indole-3-Butyric Acid)

**(ii) Gibberellins:**

*   Increase plant length.
*   Help in seed and bud germination.
*   Increase the development of flowers and fruits.
*   Uses: To lengthen dwarf plants and increase fruit size.
*   Examples: GA1, GA2, GA3 (Gibberellic Acid)

**(iii) Cytokinins:**

*   Promote cell division.
*   Prevent leaf yellowing (senescence).
*   Reduce apical dominance and promote lateral branching.
*   Uses: In tissue culture.
*   Examples: Kinetin, Zeatin, Benzyladenine


**Inhibitory Growth Regulators:**

These hormones stop excessive plant growth and control it according to external adverse conditions.

**(i) Abscisic Acid (ABA):**

*   Also called the stress hormone.
*   Helps in leaf fall (abscission) and protects the plant from drought.
*   Maintains seed dormancy.
*   Uses: To protect plants in dry or low-water areas.

**(ii) Ethylene:**

*   Helps in fruit ripening.
*   Helps in the shedding of flowers and leaves.
*   Helps the plant respond to stress conditions.
*   Uses: To ripen fruits quickly (e.g., banana, mango, tomato).


# Sexual and Asexual Reproduction in Plants

Reproduction in plants is the biological process by which they produce their offspring. It is of two types:

1.  **Asexual Reproduction:** Offspring are produced from only one parent.
2.  **Sexual Reproduction:** New plants are formed from the union of male and female gametes.


**Asexual Reproduction:**

In this type of reproduction, only one plant produces offspring, and the offspring are exactly like the parent. This can happen through various methods:

**(i) Vegetative Propagation:**

*   Plants produce new plants from their stems, leaves, roots, or branches.
*   Examples:
    *   From roots: Sweet potato, carrot
    *   From stem: Potato, ginger, onion
    *   From leaves: Bryophyllum

**(ii) Spore Formation:**

*   Some plants reproduce by producing spores.
*   Examples: Fern, Fungi, Moss

**(iii) Fragmentation:**

*   The plant body breaks into different parts, and each part forms a new plant.
*   Example: Spirogyra

**(iv) Budding:**

*   A small part grows on the parent plant and later separates to form a new plant.
*   Example: Yeast


**Sexual Reproduction:**

A new plant is formed from the fusion of male and female gametes. This process takes place in flowers because flowers are the reproductive organs of plants.

**Flower Structure:**

A flower is mainly divided into four parts:

1.  **Male Reproductive Organ (Androecium) (Stamen):**
    *   Contains anther and filament.
    *   The anther contains pollen grains, which are the male gametes.
2.  **Female Reproductive Organ (Gynoecium) (Carpel/Pistil):**
    *   Contains stigma, style, and ovary.
    *   The ovary contains ovules, which are the female gametes.
3.  **Petals:** These are the attractive colored parts of the flower that attract pollinators (bees, butterflies).
4.  **Sepals:** These protect the flower bud.


**Process of Sexual Reproduction:**

**(i) Pollination:**

This is the process of pollen grains reaching the stigma from the anther.  It is of two types:

*   **Self-Pollination:** When pollen grains fall on the stigma of the same flower.
*   **Cross-Pollination:** When pollen grains fall on the stigma of a different flower.

**(ii) Fertilization:**

When pollen grains fall on the stigma, they reach the ovary and unite with the ovule. The fusion of male and female gametes results in a fertilized egg (zygote).

**(iii) Seed and Fruit Formation:**

After fertilization, the ovule changes into a seed and the ovary into a fruit. The seed germinates to form a new plant.

**Summary:**

*   In asexual reproduction, a single plant produces its offspring, and the new offspring are similar to the parent.
*   In sexual reproduction, there is a fusion of male and female gametes, which leads to genetic diversity.
*   Sexual reproduction is more advanced and sustainable, while asexual reproduction helps produce more plants quickly.
