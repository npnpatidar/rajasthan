## **Ch-1: States of Matter**

*   What is matter?
    *   Matter is anything that occupies space and has mass.
    *   It's made up of atoms and molecules.
    *   There are three main states: Solid, Liquid, Gas
    *   Modern science also includes *Plasma and Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC)*.

*   **States of Matter and their Properties**
    *   **(i) Solid State**
        *   Molecules in solids are tightly packed and vibrate.
        *   Intermolecular attractive forces are very high.
        *   Solids have a *definite shape and volume*.
        *   Molecules are fixed in place, so solids are rigid.
        *   Examples: ice, iron, wood, copper
*   **Characteristics of Solids**
    *   High density
    *   Incompressible
    *   Diffusion is absent or very slow.

*   **(ii) Liquid State**
    *   Molecules are less densely packed than in solids.
    *   Intermolecular attractive forces are weaker than in solids.
    *   *Definite volume but no definite shape*.
    *   Liquids can flow and have surface tension.
    *   Examples: water, mercury, milk, oil
*   **Characteristics of Liquids**
    *   Incompressible
    *   Diffusion is faster than in solids.
    *   Volume is definite but shape is not.
    *   Bernoulli's Theorem and Surface Tension are important.

*   **(iii) Gaseous State**
    *   Intermolecular attractive forces are the weakest.
    *   Gases have *no definite shape or volume.*
    *   Gas particles move freely and fill the entire space.
    *   Examples: oxygen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide
*   **Characteristics of Gases**
    *   Compressible
    *   Diffusion is very fast.
    *   Gas properties are understood through Boyle's Law, Charles' Law, and the Ideal Gas Equation.

*   **(iv) Plasma State**
    *   Contains a *mixture of positive ions and free electrons.*
    *   Gas turns into plasma under *extreme heat and energy.*
    *   Can conduct electricity and is sensitive to magnetic fields.
    *   Examples: Sun, stars, lightning, neon bulbs
*   **Characteristics of Plasma**
    *   It is a *highly energetic state.*
    *   Contains charged particles that react to electric and magnetic fields.

*   **(v) Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC)**
    *   At *extremely low temperatures (near -273°C)*, *atoms merge into a single quantum state.*






---

*   Albert *Einstein and Satyendra Nath Bose* theoretically proposed it, and it was experimentally proven in 1995.
*   Example: *Superfluid helium-4*
*   **Characteristics of BEC**
    *   Molecules behave like a single giant particle.
    *   Diffusion is very slow.

*   **Process of Changing States (Phase Changes of Matter)**
    *   Matter can change from one state to another under the influence of temperature and pressure.
        *   **(i) Melting**
            *   When a solid turns into a liquid upon increasing temperature.
            *   Example: Ice turning into water (at 0°C).
        *   **(ii) Evaporation**
            *   When a liquid turns into a gas.
            *   This happens due to increased temperature and increased kinetic energy of surface molecules.
            *   Example: Water turning into steam (at 100°C).
        *   **(iii) Condensation**
            *   When a gas turns into a liquid.
            *   Example: Steam turning into water.
        *   **(iv) Sublimation**
            *   When a solid directly turns into a gas without becoming a liquid.
            *   Example: Camphor and dry ice (CO2).
        *   **(v) Freezing**
            *   When a liquid turns into a solid.
            *   Example: Water turning into ice.

*   **Gas Laws**
    *   Various laws are important to understand the properties of gases.
        *   **(i) Boyle's Law**
            *   The product of pressure (P) and volume (V) remains constant if the temperature is constant.
            * pv = constant if T = constant
        *   **(ii) Charles' Law**
            *   If the pressure is constant, the volume of a gas is proportional to the temperature.
        *   **(iii) Gay-Lussac's Law**
            *   If the volume is constant, the pressure of a gas is proportional to the temperature.
        *   **(iv) Ideal Gas Equation**
            *   PV = nRT, where
                *   P = Pressure
                *   V = Volume
                *   n = Number of moles
                *   R = Gas constant
                *   T = Temperature

*   **Important Points**
    *   Five states of matter - Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, BEC.
    *   Processes of state change - Melting, Evaporation, Condensation, Freezing, Sublimation.

---

*   **Major Principles of Metallurgy**
    *   **(i) Minerals and Ores**
        *   Minerals: Natural compounds in which metals are found are called minerals.
        *   Ores: Minerals from which metals can be extracted profitably are called ores.
        *   Examples:
            *   *Iron Ores → Hematite (Fe₂O₃), Magnetite (Fe₃O₄)*
            *   *Aluminum Ore → Bauxite (Al₂O₃.2H₂O)*
            *   *Zinc Ore → Zinc Blende (ZnS), Calamine (ZnCO₃)*
    *   **(ii) Important Principles for Metal Extraction**
        1.  Reactivity Series:
            *   More reactive metals are extracted from their ores with more energy.
            *   Less reactive metals are extracted by simple chemical methods.
        2.  Ellingham Diagram:
            *   Indicates the temperature required for the reduction of a metal oxide.
            *   More negative Gibbs free energy (ΔG°) means more stable compounds.
        3.  *Gangue and Slag:*
            *   Impurities found with ores are called gangue.
            *   Flux is added to remove gangue, forming slag.

*   **Methods of Metal Extraction**
    *   **(i) Concentration of Ores**
        *   The following methods are used to increase the concentration of metal in an ore:

                *   Example: Removing impurities from *tin stone (SnO₂).*
            2.  *Magnetic Separation*
                *   If the ore has magnetic properties, it is separated from non-magnetic substances.
                *   Example: *Magnetite (Fe₃O₄) and Pyrolusite (MnO₂).*
            3.  *Froth Flotation Method*
                *   This method is useful for *sulfide ores.*

- When added to food items containing fats and oils, antioxidants **retard oxidation, prevent rancidity, and prevent spoilage**.
- Antioxidants work by **reacting with free radicals and stopping the oxidation of food**.
- The two most familiar antioxidants  are **butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxy anisole (BHA)**.
- The addition of **BHA to butter increases its shelf life from months to years**.
- Sometimes **BHT and BHA are added along with citric acid to produce a more effective antioxidant effect**.
- **Sulphur dioxide and sulphite are useful antioxidants for wine and beer, sugar syrups, and cut, peeled, or dried fruits and vegetables**.
- **Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) can show a more active synergistic effect when added with BHT and BHA**.
- **Common salt, sugar, and oils are mentioned as natural food preservatives**. These work by various mechanisms, including resisting the activity of microorganisms. While not explicitly called antioxidants in that context, they contribute to preventing spoilage, which can involve oxidation.
- Keeping food items in **airtight containers helps to slow down the oxidation process**.
- Chips manufacturers often **flush bags of chips with nitrogen gas to prevent the oxidation of oil present in the chips**.
- The term **"anti-oxidants" is usually used for substances that prevent oxidation**.


**Natural Antioxidants:**

**Sources:**

*   Vitamin C (lemon, orange, amla)
