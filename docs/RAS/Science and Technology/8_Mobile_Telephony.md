# Mobile Telephony

Mobile telephony refers to a *wireless communication system* that allows users to make voice calls, send text messages, and access data services through portable devices like mobile phones and tablets. It utilizes *radio frequencies* to connect devices without physical wires.

## Definition and Key Features

### Definition
Mobile telephony is a wireless communication system that enables users to make voice calls, send text messages, and access data services using portable devices such as mobile phones and tablets.

### Key Features
* **Wireless Communication**: Connects devices using radio frequencies, eliminating the need for physical wires.
* **Cellular Technology**: Divides geographical areas into smaller regions called "cells," each served by a base station.
* **Portability**: Users can move freely while maintaining a connection to the network.
* **Network Switching**: Calls and data are seamlessly transferred between cells as the user moves (a process called "*handoff*" or "*handover*").
* **Real-Time Access**: Enables instant voice calls, messaging, and internet usage.

## Components of a Mobile Telephony System

Mobile communication relies on a *cellular network structure*, where the coverage area is divided into cells, typically hexagonal in shape. Each cell is served by a *base station* (also called BTS - Base Trans-receiver Station) that provides the signal and communicates with mobile devices within that cell.

* **Cell Towers (Base Stations)**: Responsible for covering a specific geographical area and facilitating communication with mobile devices in that area. They are connected in a grid to provide seamless coverage.
* **Mobile Devices (User Equipment)**: Include mobile phones, smartphones, and other portable communication devices that send and receive signals. A cell phone contains both a *low-power transmitter and receiver* and can use both simultaneously, understand different frequencies, and automatically switch between them.
* **Mobile Switching Centers (MSC)**: Central components that connect base stations to the core network, routing calls and data between base stations and external networks (like the PSTN or internet). They also manage handoffs.
* **Core Network**: The backbone of the mobile telephony system, connecting all base stations and switching centers to external networks.
* **Backhaul Network**: The infrastructure that connects base stations to the core network, typically via fiber optic cables or microwave links.

## Signal Processing and Transmission Techniques

### Modulation
The process of *altering the characteristics of a high-frequency carrier wave* (such as amplitude, frequency, or phase) in accordance with the baseband signal (information) for efficient transmission over long distances.
* **Amplitude Modulation (AM)**: Varies the amplitude of the carrier wave. Used in AM radio broadcasting.
* **Frequency Modulation (FM)**: Varies the frequency of the carrier wave. Used in FM radio broadcasting and TV transmission.
* **Phase Modulation (PM)**: Varies the phase of the carrier wave.
* **Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)**: Used in digital systems to transmit multiple bits per symbol.
* **Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)**: A digital modulation technique for pulsed carrier waves, where the signal is sampled, quantized, and transmitted as a binary code.

### Multiplexing
Allows *multiple users or signals to share the same frequency channel simultaneously*.
* **Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)**: Divides the available frequency spectrum into separate channels, with each user allocated a *unique frequency slot* during a call.
* **Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)**: Allocates specific time slots for users to share the same frequency. This *increased capacity* compared to FDMA.
* **Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)**: Allows multiple users to share the *entire available spectrum simultaneously* by encoding each user's information with a unique code. It is known for higher capacity and security.
* **Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)**: An advanced technique that splits the frequency band into many smaller subcarriers, reducing interference and increasing data rates. Used in 4G and 5G.

### Switching Techniques
Determine how connections are established and managed.
* **Circuit Switching**: A *dedicated communication path* is established and maintained for the entire duration of the communication. Used primarily for voice calls in early mobile generations.
* **Packet Switching**: Data is broken into smaller units called "*packets*" and sent individually over *shared network paths*. Bandwidth is shared dynamically, making it more efficient for data transmission. Used for data services in 3G, and for both voice and data in 4G and 5G.
