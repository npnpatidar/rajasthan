# World Economy

## Syllabus 

*   Global Economic issues and trends: Role of World Bank, IMF & WTO.

## Global Economic Issues

Major issues of the global economy include-
1.  Tariff War
2.  Trade Protectionism
3.  Trade War
4.  De-Dollarization
5.  Crude Oil Prices
6.  Global Conflict (Ukraine, Israel-Palestine conflict)
7.  Second Great Depression
8.  Climate Change
9.  Inflation
10. Global Supply Chains

The current global economy is facing polycrisis. (World Economic Outlook-2025)

1.  **Tariff War:** Reciprocal tariff war (by Trump) has pushed the world into recession leading to - dumping of products, weaponization of rare minerals (by China), geopolitical polarization, collapse of global value chains and the potential end of globalization.
2.  **Trade Protectionism:** Under this, restrictions on imports are imposed to help domestic industries, which increases the demand for domestic goods and services. The purpose of this protectionism is to strengthen the domestic economy. For example, the USA has been promoting protectionist policies since 2018-19.
    *   Protectionist policies - They become negative in the long run, they slow down growth rate, degrade product quality and lead to unemployment (retrenchment).
3.  **De-Dollarization** - With the aim of reducing US economic dominance, efforts are being made by economies like India, China, Russia, Brazil through de-dollarization i.e. increasing the acceptance of other currencies in place of the dollar.
4.  **Second Great Depression** - The Corona pandemic has created the most terrible situation after the 1929 global economic crisis, where the unemployment rate is at the highest level. Due to which not only economic but also social, policy making and political stability is being affected.
5.  **US-China Trade War** - The increase in tariff rates on Chinese imports by the US has increased the threat of dumping in India, especially in the steel and aluminium sectors. Due to which there is a possibility of decline in the Indian currency.
6.  **Global Supply Chains** - The cross-border movement of goods, services and information – have been impacted by COVID-19, which has been exacerbated by recent geopolitical crises, leading to global imbalances in demand and supply, leading to rising inflation.

## Global Economic Trends

1.  The world's average growth rate will be 3 percent sequentially. (World Economic Outlook Report 2025)
2.  The average economic growth rate of developed economies will be 1.5 percent, while the average growth rate of developing and emerging economies will be 5.2 percent.
3.  The debt/GDP ratio (global) has reached 100 percent.
4.  Global inflation was 7 percent in the year 2024, which will reduce to 3.5 percent in 2025.
5.  Growth rate will remain slow due to strict monetary policies as most of the world's central banks have controlled liquidity to fight inflation.
6.  Climate crisis – Heat waves, forest fires, floods, earthquakes, cyclones are causing large-scale economic and human losses.
7.  World economy will be negatively affected due to other factors such as - geopolitical conflict (Russia-Ukraine, Israel-Palestine conflict), natural resource crisis, cyber crime, social polarization.
8.  Slow pace of global reforms.

**Measures to strengthen the global economy:**
1.  To improve the administrative and business environment of multilateral financial institutions (WB, IMF, WTO).

**Quota System**
*   The role of member countries in the IMF is determined by the quota system.
*   Quota is determined on the basis of 4 factors.
    1.  *GDP*- weight 50%
    2.  *Openness* of the economy – weightage 30%
    3.  *Dynamics* of Economy – Weightage 15%
    4.  *Foreign exchange reserves* – weightage 5%

Three types of roles are determined by the quota system.

**1. Contribution -**
*   It determines how much resources a country has to contribute to the IMF.
*   *25%* of the money has to be deposited in *hard currency or gold* which is called *Reserve Tranche.*
*   HARD CURRENCY – Currencies that are accepted for global payments. Like - $, € (euro), Pound
*   *75%* of the money has to be deposited in *domestic currency.*
*   Currently India is the *8th largest* quota holder.
*   14th Quota Review – implemented in 2016 in which India's quota was increased to 2.76%.
*   15th Quota Review – There is no change in quota.
*   16th Quota Review - The process has started.

**2. Vote Value**
*   The country which has higher quota also has higher vote value. Highest vote value – USA (about 17%)
*   To take a decision in the Board of Governors, *85% votes* are required, that is, no decision can be taken without the consent of the USA.
*   India's voting percentage is 2.63 percent.

**3. Debt Capacity**
*   200% of the quota can be borrowed in 1 year. The total loan cannot exceed *600% of the quota.*
*   For obtaining loan, conditions like 1. LPG improvement 2. Reduction in fiscal deficit are kept.

2.  It is used for sovereign payments.
3.  SDRs are allocated by IMF to help in the foreign exchange reserves of member countries.
4.  SDR started in 1969. SDR is also called *paper gold*.
5.  Initially the value of 1 SDR
    1SDR = 1$ = 0.88 gm gold
6.  Currently the value of 1 SDR is calculated on the basis of 5 currencies-
    1. US Dollar 
    2. Euro 
    3. Chinese Renminbi 
    4. Japanese Yen 
    5. British Pound

*   Extended Credit Facility (ECF): Payment in case of prolonged balance of payments problem
*   Standby Credit Facility (SCF) – Short-term payments due to policy lapses
*   Rapid Credit Facility (RCF): Lump sum disbursement


**IMF problems**
1.  Biased structural framework - Under which developed countries have more voting and quota rights.
2.  Violation of sovereignty - IMF's lending conditions violate the political and economic sovereignty of nations.
3.  Excessive support to the capitalist system
4.  Pressure on developing countries to implement reforms and policies in one go instead of sequentially.
5.  Due to dictatorial attitude, emergence of alternative institutions such as BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA).

1.  Selection of chief should be merit based (governance reform)
2.  Eliminating USA's veto power (17 percent voting quota) in decision making.
3.  Immediately implement the results of the review policy for quota determination.
4.  To increase the decision-making role of developing and developed countries. (Changes in internal administrative laws).


## WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO)

*   Established – January 1, 1995 (*Marrakesh Agreement*, Arthur Declaration)
*   Headquarters – Geneva
*   Members – 166 (165th - Comoros, 166th - Timor-Leste)

**Work:**
1.  The main function of WTO is to promote world trade. (98 percent of trade to the world)
2.  WTO provides a rules based, transparent and multilateral trading system.

4.  To remove tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade.
    *   Tariff Barrier – Import duty and export duty
    *   Non-tariff barriers – license requirements, quality standards, quotas, rule of origin, negative list, customs rules.
5.  Monitoring national trade policies
*   Before WTO, an organization called GATT existed.
    GATT - General Agreement Trade and Tariff
*   This agreement was made in 1947 and came into force in 1948.

**Difference between GATT and WTO**

| GATT                             | WTO                                                                                             |
| :------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. There was general agreement   | WTO is a legal institution and its powers come from the Marrakesh Treaty (Morocco).             |
| 2. Its decisions are not binding. | Its decisions are binding.                                                                      |
| 3. It was limited to trade in goods. | It relates to goods as well as services, investments, intellectual property etc.                |

**Structure of WTO – It has a three-tier structure-**

**1. Ministerial Conference (MC):**
*   It is the highest decision making body, the commerce ministers of the member countries participate in it.
*   Till now this conference has been organized 12 times, the 12th ministerial conference was held in Geneva (Switzerland) in 2022.
*   The first conference was held in Singapore in 1996.
*   Doha Conference - 2001 (4th)

*   Abu Dhabi - 2024

**2. General Council:**
There are two main institutions in it.
1.  Trade Policy Review Body
2.  Dispute settlement body – Trade related complaints are resolved by member countries.
    Under this, an appellate body is formed. Seven members are elected as judges for four years. Its decisions are binding. Due to the ban on appointment of new judges by America, the Supreme Court is not able to function. As a result of this crisis, 23 WTO countries have formed a temporary mechanism 'Multiparty Internal Arbitration (MPIA)'.
    Other councils -
    1.  Commodity Trade Council
    2.  Service Trade Council
    3.  Intellectual Property Rights Council

***WTO Reports - It mainly releases three reports.***
1.  World Trade Report-2024: Estimated decline of 2.2% in world trade.
2.  Annual Reports:
3.  International Trade Statistics

**Major Principles Of WTO**
1.  **Most Favored Nation (MFN)**-A member country of the WTO grants the status of MFN to other member countries. If any trade facility is given to a country having MFN status, then that facility is automatically given to another country having MFN status. This status is given to provide non-discriminatory market access.

2.  **Principle of national treatment** – Treating foreigners and locals equally. There should not be any kind of discrimination between a domestic company and a foreign company. Imported and locally produced goods should be treated equally – Less After entry of foreign goods into the market.

3. **Special and Differential Treatment (SDT) with Developing Countries-**
    1.  Developing countries are given more time to complete the agreements.
    2.  There is a special provision relating to less developed countries. (LDC)
    3.  Measures to increase trade opportunities for these countries.

**Main agreements of WTO -**

**1. Agreement on Agriculture (AOA):**
*   This agreement was made in 1994. In this agreement, subsidies were considered to be market distorting.
*   To implement market based agricultural trade.
*   Reduction in domestic support to agriculture.
    Subsidy was divided into 3 categories.

    **(1). AMBER BOX :**
    *   In this, those subsidies were kept which are dependent on production, that is, as production increases, the amount of subsidy also increases.
    *   This was considered to be the most distorting of the market.
    *   This subsidy cannot be given more than a certain limit.
    *   Fixed limit - 5% of the average agricultural production of 1986-87 of developed countries and 10% of the average agricultural production of 1986-87 of developing countries was fixed.
    *   To implement this, developed countries were given 6 years and developing countries were given 10 years from 1994.
        Example – Fertilizer subsidy, MSP, electricity subsidy.

    **(2). BLUE BOX :**
    *   It contains those subsidies which distort the market to a limited extent.
    *   This subsidy is not based on production.
    *   These should also be stopped but its quantity and time limit were not determined.
        Example - Kisan Samman Nidhi

    **(3). GREEN BOX:**
    *   In this, those subsidies are kept which encourage research in the agricultural sector. No limit was imposed on such subsidies.

**Major agricultural disputes:**
1.  In the Doha Round of 2001, there was a dispute between developed and developing countries, developing countries objected that most of their subsidies were kept under Amber Box while the subsidies of developed countries were kept in Blue Box/Green Box. While determining the subsidy limit in the Amber Box, developed countries were given a higher limit, while developing countries were given a lower limit.

2.  **Food Security Controversy**- National Food Security act was imposed by India in 2013. Under it 67% of India's population was given the right to food. That is, grains will be distributed by the government at cheaper rates.
    *   For this, large quantity agri product purchases will be made by the government, that is, large quantity purchases will be made from farmers, that is, MSP subsidy will be given to the farmers. This subsidy was violating the amber box limits, hence it was challenged in WTO. India's argument in this was that this purchase is being done to provide food security to the poor people. Its purpose is not to distort world trade.
    *   This was discussed in the Bali conference in 2013. India was given a peace clause arrangement. Initially for 4 years and extended at the Nairobi Conference in 2015 until the matter is resolved.
    *   Peace clause means that India's food security program cannot be challenged in WTO. This case is called the case of Public Stockholding.

**2. NON Agriculture Market Access (NAMA)**
*   Developed countries demanded that tariff barriers on non-agricultural products should be reduced.
*   A SWISS FORMULA was given for this.
    SWISS FORMULA
    T<sub>new</sub> = (A x T<sub>old</sub>) / (A + T<sub>old</sub>)
    A = maximum fee
    T<sub>old</sub> = old fee
    T<sub>new</sub> = new charge

**3. Intellectual Property Rights TRIPS :**
*   The wealth that has been developed by the human brain is called intellectual wealth.
*   Developed countries allege that intellectual property rights are not respected in developing countries.
*   Intellectual property rights such as Patent
*   There are two types of Patents-
    1.  Process Patent
    2.  Product Patent
*   Initially only process patents were recognized by developing countries.
*   But after 2005, product patents were also recognized.
    *   In India, patent is given for 20 years.
*   That means the patent holder will have a monopoly in the market for 20 years. No one else can make this product.
*   Intellectual property rights are recognized in WTO, for this TRIPS (Trade Related aspects of Intellectual property Rights) agreement was made.
*   It recognizes all types of intellectual property rights.
    *   Like - Patent, Industrial design, GI-tag, Trade Mark, Copyrights
*   The TRIPS Agreement does not allow Evergreening. Evergreening – Frequent renewal of patent. Main controversy related to this in India - GLIVEC
*   The TRIPS Agreement allows Compulsory License. This is an exception under which generic medicines can be manufactured even during the patent period. A related case in India is Nexavar.

**4. GATS:**
*   General Agreement on Trade in Services
*   In WTO, services are divided into 4 categories-
    1.  MODE-1: Those services which are provided in another country while living in one country. Ex. - BPO Call Center
    2.  MODE-2: Those services which are consumed in another country. Ex. - Tourism.
    3.  MODE-3: Investments made in the service sector are kept in this category. Ex. - Hotel, Banking, Insurance, Telecom
    4.  Mode-4: Human resources are kept under this. Ex. – Doctor, Engineer
*   Developed countries want simpler rules for Mode-3 services while developing countries want simpler rules for Mode-4 services. That means there should be no problem with visa.

**5. TRIMS :** Trade Related Investment Measures
*   The main objective of this agreement is to promote investment. Under this, an important principle is-
    Principle of national treatment – There should be no discrimination between a domestic company and a foreign company.
*   The dispute over solar energy between India and the USA is linked to the principle of national behaviour.

**6. Agreement on Textile and Cloths (ATC)**
*   Multifiber Arrangement (1974) Under this, each country was allowed to determine the quota of other countries for the textile industry.
*   In 2005 it was replaced by the Agreement on Textile and Clothes. Under which the quota was abolished.

**7. ANTI DUMPING DUTY (ADD):**
*   If a product is sold in the foreign market at a price lower than the domestic market price then this process is called dumping.
    Main objectives of dumping:
    1.  Establishing a monopoly on the foreign market.
    2.  Disposal of excess production
    3.  Earning foreign exchange.
*   WTO considers the process of dumping unfair i.e. the importing country can impose anti dumping duty to stop dumping.
*   In India, it is recommended by the Ministry of Commerce and imposed by the Finance Ministry.

**8. Countervailing Duty (CVD):**
*   If a country gives subsidy to domestic producers, which reduces the price of the products, then countervailing duty is imposed by the importing country to overcome the effect of subsidy.

**9. Special Safe Guard Mechanism (SSM):**
*   If agricultural imports in a country increase so much that domestic farmers start incurring losses, then the government can impose taxes to stop such imports.
*   This system is called SSM.

**10. Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS):**
*   Sets forth necessary regulations for food safety and animal and plant health standards.
*   Allows countries to line up their own standards
*   If a consumable item is imported into a country and the importing country feels that consumption of the item may have a negative impact on its people, animals and environment. Then such products can be banned. Ex.
    *   Indian generic and generic medicines were banned in Europe.
    *   Indian Basmati rice was banned in China.

**11. Most Favored Nation (MFN)**
*   A WTO member country grants MFN status to other member countries.
*   If a trade facility is given to a country having MFN status, then that facility is automatically given to another country having MFN status.
*   This status is given to provide non-discriminatory market access.
*   In 1996, India gave status to Pakistan but Pakistan did not give any such status to India.
*   India withdrew this status from Pakistan after the Pulwama attacks.
*   Regional agreements are an exception to the MFN concept.

**Major Regional Agreement-**

**(1) Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA)**
*   The countries between which this agreement is made are given preference over other countries.
    Ex. South Asian Preferential Trade Agreement (SAPTA) It came into force in 1995. There is less duty on import.

**(2) Free Trade Agreement (FTA)**
*   Free trade is conducted between the countries between which this agreement is made.
*   Negative List – Goods that are placed in the negative list are kept out of a free trade agreement.
*   If the negative list is too large then the free trade agreement is not very effective i.e. it is a non-tariff barrier.

**Rule of Origin**
*   The benefit of a free trade agreement is given only to those goods whose certain percentage is produced in the country with which the free trade agreement has been signed.
*   For example, if a free trade agreement is made between India and Nepal and the Rule of Origin is also applicable, then it means that only those goods will get the benefit of the free trade agreement, more than 35% of which are produced in Nepal.
*   If the Rule of Origin is rigid then the free trade agreement is not very effective.
