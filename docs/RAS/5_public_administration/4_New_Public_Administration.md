# Public Administration 

## I. New Public Administration (NPA)

* **Origin:** Developed in the USA in 1968.
* **Context:**  Socio-economic turbulence in the USA pre-1968, characterized by:
    * Unemployment
    * Poverty
    * Rapid urbanization & slums
    * Environmental pollution
    * Transportation problems
* **Contributing Factors:**
    * **Social and economic turmoil:** Blaming between politicians and civil servants for lack of development.
    * **1967 Honey Report:** Highlighted failures of public administration leading to unemployment and poverty, due to inadequate policy execution and lack of development of Public Administration as a subject in the USA.  Recommended scholarships for students, economic aid for researchers, and establishment of a National Institute of Public Administration (NIPA) for research and development.
    * **1967 Philadelphia Conference (Charlesworth):** Addressed problems stemming from the politics-administration dichotomy advocated by Woodrow Wilson.  Proposed flexibility in hierarchy, decentralization, and focusing on problems like poverty, unemployment, and environmental pollution.
* **Minnowbrook Conferences:** Series of conferences held every 20 years (1968, 1988, 2008, next in 2028) to redefine public administration.
    | Conference | Year | Chair | Focus | Key Themes |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | 1st | 1968 | Dwight Waldo | Socio-economic turmoil | Value, equity, relevance, change; criticized public administration |
    | 2nd | 1988 |  Rickson | Era of LPG (Liberalization, Privatization, Globalization) | Efficiency, economy, effectiveness, information technology; limited role for public administration |
    | 3rd | 2008 | Rosemary O'Leary | Economic crisis, mobile governance | Transparency, accountability, responsibility; significant role for civil servants; "The Future of Public Administration, Public Service and Public Management" |

* **Features of NPA:**
    * Rejection of the politics-administration dichotomy.
    * Decentralization.
    * Four goals: Value, Equity, Relevance, Change.
    * Emphasis on changing the attitude of civil servants.
    * Public participation in public administration.
    * Support for de-bureaucratization/downsizing of bureaucracy.
    * Client sensitivity orientation.

* **Criticism of NPA:**
    * Lack of integrity: simultaneously advocating for and against bureaucracy.
    * Overemphasis on values.
    * Initially irrelevant for developing countries (like India in 1968).


## II. NPA's Relevance in India and Developing Countries

* **Rejection of Politics-Administration Dichotomy:** Already largely rejected in India; bureaucrats play a significant role.
* **Decentralization:** Achieved through the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments (1993), empowering Panchayati Raj Institutions and Urban Local Bodies.
* **Public Participation:** Promoted through RTI, social audits, citizen charters, and public service guarantee acts.
* **Flexibility in Hierarchy:** Facilitated by e-governance, reducing reliance on rigid hierarchical structures.
* **Change in Attitude of Civil Servants:** Addressed through various committees and recommendations (e.g.,  Yugohinder Committee, Surendranath Chaturvedi Committee), leading to greater emphasis on ethics in civil services.
* **De-bureaucratization/Downsizing:** Implemented through the Golden Handshake scheme (VRS for underperforming PSU employees), lateral entry schemes, and recommendations from the Fifth Pay Commission to abolish 30% of government jobs.
