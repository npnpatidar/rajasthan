# Public Administration

## Key Concepts in Public Administration

### 1. Power, Authority, and Legitimacy

* **Power:** The art of influencing individuals or groups according to one's will. It's an individual ability, can be positive or negative.
* **Authority:** The right to give orders and the power to enforce obedience.  Legitimacy is crucial; power becomes authority when legitimized.
    * **Characteristics:** Expanded form of power, centralized at higher organizational levels, flows top-down, delegatable.
    * **Sources:** Constitution, laws, codes, and regulations.
    * **Types:**
        * **Line Authority:**  Authority involved in decision-making and directing staff (e.g., government departments, ministries).
        * **Staff Authority:** Authority that advises line authority in decision-making; also called specific or specialized authority (e.g., NITI Aayog, State Planning Board).
        * **Functional Authority:** Power given in specific situations; not permanent (e.g., departmental promotion authority delegated to RPSC).
        * **Max Weber's Typology:**
            * **Traditional Authority:** Power transferred traditionally (e.g., monarchy). Also known as "Power in the Chair".
            * **Charismatic Authority:** Power derived from the leader's charismatic personality (e.g., Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela).
            * **Legal Authority:** Power derived from legal frameworks (Constitution, laws); considered the best form by Max Weber.

* **Importance of Authority:** Ensures coordination, inspection, direction, and supervision; enables delegation of work; maintains discipline; motivates subordinates.


### 2. Responsibility and Accountability

* **Responsibility:** Obligation to do or not do something in a particular way. Necessary for controlling power. Classical thinkers emphasized its link to power.
* **Accountability:** Legal obligation; actions have legal consequences (e.g., electoral duty).
* **Difference between Responsibility and Accountability:**
    | Feature        | Responsibility                      | Accountability                        |
    |----------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
    | Nature         | Personal and moral                  | Legal obligation                     |
    | Applicability  | Personal, general, and military admin | General and military administration |
    | Consciousness | Self-conscious                      | Organizational conscious               |

### 3. Delegation

* **Delegation:** Transferring or shifting work from a higher authority to a subordinate due to excessive workload or lack of specialization.
    * **Elements:** Work, authority, and responsibility.
    * **Dual Nature:** Divides authority between higher and subordinate.
    * **Temporary Nature:** Usually for a limited time.
    * **Internal Process:** Occurs within, not between, organizations.
    * **Narrow Approach:** Compared to decentralization.
    * **Associated with Hierarchy:** Follows hierarchical principles.
    * **Accountability:** Rests with the higher authority; responsibility with the subordinate.
    * **Types:**
        * **Written/Oral:** Based on the mode of communication.
        * **Direct/Indirect:** Based on the presence of a mediator.
        * **Formal/Informal:** Based on rules, regulations, or conventions.
        * **Temporary/Permanent:** Based on duration.
        * **General/Specific:** Based on scope of work transferred.


* **Importance and Reasons for Delegation:** Reduces workload; promotes specialization; develops managerial skills in subordinates; develops administrative leadership; saves time and resources; motivates subordinates; resolves technical difficulties; provides a learning platform for subordinates; allows higher authority to focus on other important activities; increases span of control.

* **Hurdles in Delegation:** Limited organizational size; lack of human and economic resources; lack of coordination; lack of proper training; higher authority ego; lack of self-confidence in subordinates; lack of will power; past failures in delegation; lack of trust in subordinates.

* **Ideal Conditions for Delegation:** Written communication; rewards and recognition system; unity of command; proper training arrangements; proper management of resources.
