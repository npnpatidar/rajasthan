# Public Administration: Nature, Perspectives, and Role

## I. Nature of Public Administration

**A. As a Subject:**

* **Debate:**  Is Public Administration a science, an art, or neither?
    * **Science proponents (e.g., Woodrow Wilson, Lowell):**
        * **Arguments:**
            * Universal principles (hierarchy, division of labor).
            * Research & development (e.g., New Public Management, New Public Administration).
            * Use of scientific methods & techniques (CPM, PERT).
            * Value-free (like science).
            * Predictive capabilities (policy formulation).
            * Administrator as counselor/advisor to politicians.
            * Universal texts (Kautilya's Arthashastra, Aristotle's Politics, Plato's Republic).
            * Interdisciplinary nature (combines polity, management, law, ethics, sociology, psychology).

    * **Non-science proponents (e.g., Robert Dahl, Paul Appleby, Cohen, Morris):**
        * **Arguments:**
            * Value-oriented (administrators are human, guided by ethics and code of conduct).
            * Lack of accuracy in prediction.
            * Variable administrator behavior.
            * Absence of a laboratory setting.
            * Ecological â€“  variable with environment and circumstances.


    * **Art proponents (e.g., M.P. Sharma, Tead):**
        * **Arguments:**
            * Civil servants' creativity (like artists).
            * Need for a medium (organization for civil servants, materials for artists).
            * Variable with time and space (like art).
            * Training required for both artists and civil servants.
            * Importance of personality for both.

    * **Neither Science nor Art:**  Some consider it a social science subject, gradually evolving.

**B. As a System:**

* **Managerial Nature:** Focuses only on higher authority and post-curb activities (planning, organizing, staffing, directing, coordinating, reporting, budgeting).  Narrow view.
* **Integral Nature:** Includes all organizational members, from top to bottom. Broader view.


## II. Role of Public Administration in Developed and Developing Countries

**A. Developed Countries:**

* **Features:** Transparency, accountability, responsibility; significant role of specialists in policy-making; professionalism in bureaucracy; decentralized administration; high public participation; qualitative public service delivery; constitutional commitment; flexible rules and regulations; good coordination between politicians and civil servants; efficient service delivery; emphasis on resource management, innovation, and adaptation.  **TAR** (Transparency, Accountability, Responsibility) is a key concept to remember.


**B. Developing Countries:**

* **Features:** Colonial legacy; dominant role of generalists in policy-making; administrative corruption; excessive emphasis on rules and regulations; conflict between ministers and civil servants; lack of public participation; red tape; quantitative rather than qualitative role of administration.  Origin of Development Administration: 1955.

| Bureaucracy      | Auto-developed, evolved organically      | Colonial legacy                         |
| Bureaucracy Role | Qualitative                               | Quantitative                             |
| Coordination     | Good between civil servants & ministers | Conflict                               |
| Rules & Regs     | Flexible                                  | Overemphasis                             |
| Key Development  | New Public Administration (NPA) 1968    | Development Administration (DA) 1955   |
| Corruption       | Negligible                                | Significant                             |
| Public Participation | High                                     | Low                                      |
