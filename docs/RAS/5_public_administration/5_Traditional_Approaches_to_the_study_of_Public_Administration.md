# Public Administration: Approaches to Study 

## I. Traditional Approaches to Studying Public Administration

Seven traditional approaches are discussed:

1. **Classical Theory:**
    * **Alternative Names:** Formal Organization Theory, Mechanical Theory, Administrative Management Theory.
    * **Key Thinkers:**  Henri Fayol, Luther Gulick, Urwick, Mooney, and Reyley.
    * **Features:**
        * Developed initial content of public administration.
        * Focused on formal organizations. (Context: around 1920s, driven by need to maximize production during wartime).
        * Supported economic/monetary motivation as primary driver.
        * Considered public and private organizations identical.
        * Viewed administration and management as synonymous.
        * Presented public administration as a science.
        * Focused on managerial levels of organization, with top-down authority flow.
        * Considered employees as "cogs in a machine".
        * Main objective: maximizing production.
    * **Criticisms:** Ignores human emotions and feelings; relies solely on monetary motivation; treats employees as mere components of a machine.
    * **Contributions/Importance:** Developed initial content; provided principles (e.g., Fayol's 14 principles, many still relevant); promoted research and development in public administration.  The difference between public and private organizations is diminishing.


2. **Scientific Management:**
    * **Key Contributors:** Frederick Taylor and Gilbreth.
    * **Taylor's Contributions:**
        * **W.S.C.D. Rule:**
            * **W (Work as Science):** Develop work science; use experiment-based methods (time study, motion study, fatigue study) instead of rules of thumb.
            * **S (Scientific Selection):** Scientifically select employees.
            * **C (Coordination):** Coordination between work and worker, worker and management.
            * **D (Division of Work):** Use scientific methods and techniques for division of work.
        * **Mental Revolution:**  Mutual support between management (providing fair wages and positive working conditions) and workers (exerting effort for maximized production).  Result: cheaper, higher quality goods for consumers.
        * **Management by Exception:** Addressing only exceptional problems, saving management time for more important tasks (indirectly opposing labor unions).
        * **Differential Piece Rate System:** Different pay for different jobs.
        * **Functional Foremanship:** Opposes the unity of command principle.
    * **Objectives:** Increase output; improve cooperation and coordination; utilize scientific methods; promote economic efficiency.
    * **Features:** Emphasizes scientific methods and techniques; optimal use of resources; supports economy and efficiency; maximizes coordination; opposes the unity of command principle; focuses on contract systems and differential piece rate systems; opposes rules of thumb; opposes labor unions; emphasizes monetary motivation.
    * **Criticisms:** Treats employees as industrial robots; ignores human feelings; focuses solely on monetary motivation; irrelevant for small organizations; overemphasizes scientific techniques.
    * **Contributions:** Introduced scientific techniques and methods (e.g., CPM/PERT); supported scientific selection (e.g., UPSC CSE); supported contract systems; emphasized economic efficiency; indirectly opposed the unity of command principle.


3. **Historical Method:** Studying the evolution and history of administrative organizations and institutions. (Example:  LD White's books on early American federal government).


4. **Legal Method:**
    * **Woodrow Wilson's Definition:** Public administration as detailed and systematic execution of public law.
    * **Focus:** Study of constitutional law (legislature, judiciary, executive) and administrative law (statutes, commissions, institutions like NHRC, CIC, SEC).


5. **Biographical Method:** Studying the autobiographies of administrators and politicians to learn from their experiences. (Examples: *The Memoirs of a Civil Servant*; *Through the Broken Glass* by T.N. Seshan).


6. **Subject Matter Method:** Studying the services provided by the government (education, health, etc.), commission reports, and departmental codes.


7. **Political Method:**  Public administration executes political will and decisions; political stability leads to administrative efficiency.
