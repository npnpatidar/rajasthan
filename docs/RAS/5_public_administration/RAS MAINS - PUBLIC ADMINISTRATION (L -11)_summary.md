    * Merit-based transfers (abolishing the "desire system")
    * Formalized transfer policy
    * Reduced negative political interference
    * Adherence to codes of conduct

* **Importance of Dedication:** Maintains discipline, ensures effective implementation of government policies and programs, optimizes resource utilization, motivates other civil servants, encourages initiative-taking, and builds a positive image of civil servants, enhancing public trust and participation.


## V. Generalists vs. Specialists

* **Origin of the Conflict:** Northcote-Trevelyan Report (1854) recommended generalists for higher administrative posts and specialists for lower posts.

* **Generalists:** Civil servants with general education, recruited and trained for higher administrative posts. Perform overall administrative activities (planning, organizing, staffing, directing, coordinating, reporting, budgeting). Examples: ACS, Divisional Commissioner, District Collector, SDM, Tehsildar.

* **Specialists:** Civil servants with technical or professional degrees, appointed to middle-level administrative posts. Examples: Doctors, Engineers, Professors, Lecturers.  Always function within the same department.

| Feature          | Generalists                               | Specialists                                  |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Education        | General                                   | Technical/Professional                       |
| Functions        | Post-administrative activities            | Technical/Specialized functions              |
| Appointment Level | Higher administrative posts                | Middle administrative posts                  |
| Political Closeness | Higher                                    | Comparatively lower                         |
| Transfers        | Inter-departmental transfers are common | Primarily within the same department         |
| Promotion        | Faster                                     | Comparatively slower                         |
| Salary/Facilities | Higher                                    | Comparatively lower                         |
| Other Names      | Bureaucrats                               | Technocrats                                 |


* **Reasons for Conflict:**
    * Generalists occupy higher administrative positions.
    * Higher salaries and facilities for generalists.
    * Fast promotions for generalists.
    * Autocratic behavior of generalists towards specialists.
    * Illogical policies formulated by generalists.
    * Unnecessary comments by generalists on specialist reports.
    * Generalists' close association with politicians.
    * Dominance of generalists in the secretariat, influencing policy formulation.


* **Solutions to the Conflict:**
    * Pre-determined allocation of posts for generalists and specialists.
    * Creation of new All India Services (e.g., All India Medical Health Services, All India Engineering Services).
    * Inclusion of specialists in policy formulation.
    * Faster promotion for specialists.
    * Similar training for generalists and specialists.
    * Integration or merging of directorates and secretariats.
    * Integrated hierarchical systems.

    * Policy formulation is an art requiring broader perspective.
    * Intellectual cream of society.

* **Arguments in Favor of Specialists:**
