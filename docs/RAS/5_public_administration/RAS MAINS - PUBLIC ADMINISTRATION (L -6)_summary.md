# Public Administration Lecture Notes

## Lecture Overview: Modern Approaches to Public Administration

This lecture continues the discussion of approaches to studying Public Administration, focusing on modern approaches.  A total of 12-13 lectures will cover the 65-mark portion of the exam, estimated to take around 4 hours.

## I. Traditional Approaches (Recap)

* Classical Theory
* Scientific Management Theory
* Historical Method
* Legal Method
* Biographical Method
* Subject Matter Method
* Political Method

## II. Modern Approaches

### A. Human Relations Theory (Neo-Classical Theory, Clinical Method, Informal Organization Theory)

* **Supporters:** Elton Mayo (key figure), Dickson, Whitehead
* **Hawthorne Studies (Western Electric, Chicago, 1924-1932):**
    * **Illumination Experiment:** Examined the relationship between light intensity and production.  Found that both increased and decreased light initially increased production, ultimately concluding that worker awareness of the experiment influenced results.
    * **Relay Assembly Test Room Experiment:** Improved physical facilities for workers; production increased accordingly,  showing the impact of improved working conditions.  Also highlighted the influence of informal organization.
    * **Mass Interview Program (1929-1931):** Conducted interviews to identify worker problems.  Increased production resulted from workers feeling heard, demonstrating the significance of non-monetary motivation.
    * **Bank Wiring Observation Room Experiment:** Studied a stable production unit.  Found that informal groups (with nicknames like "rate-busters," "chiselers," and "squealers") influenced production, maintaining a stable output to avoid repercussions.  Confirmed the influence of informal organization on productivity.

* **Features:**
    * Emphasizes the study of informal organizations.
    * Supports non-monetary motivation.
    * Focuses on job satisfaction and its impact on productivity.
    * Supports democratic leadership.
    * Recognizes the importance of labor unions.
    * Flow of authority: bottom-up.
    * Rejects the "rabble hypothesis" (workers are selfish) and supports the "Owen hypothesis" (management should focus on workers, not machines).

* **Criticisms:**
    * Excessive emphasis on informal organization; neglect of formal organization.
    * Accusations of being a "gaudy sociologist" (manipulating workers).
    * Focus only on non-monetary motivation; ignores monetary factors.
    * Small sample size in some experiments (e.g., the Illumination Experiment).

* **Relevance and Importance:**
    * Highlights the importance of non-monetary motivation (e.g., testimonials, maternity/paternity leave).
    * Supports labor unions.
    * Provides a model for increasing public participation (e.g., citizen charters, RTI, social audits).
    * Supports effective grievance redressal mechanisms (e.g., online portals, Public Service Guarantee Act).
    * Contributes to research and development in public administration.

### C. Comparison: Scientific Management vs. Human Relations Theory

* **Similarities:** Both aim to increase production and focus on coordination between management and workers. Both support democratic leadership.  Both focus on the worker/laborer.

* **Differences:**
    | Feature                | Scientific Management Theory       | Human Relations Theory                |
    |------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
    | Motivation             | Primarily monetary                 | Primarily non-monetary                 |
    | Methods                | Scientific methods and techniques | Study of informal organization          |
    | Labor Unions           | Opposed                           | Supports                              |

    | Key Supporters        | Taylor, Gilbreth                   | Elton Mayo, Dickson, Whitehead         |


### D. Behavioral Approach (Behavioral Principles)

* **Supporters:** Herbert Simon, Chester Barnard
* **Features:** A sophisticated version of Human Relations Theory. Emphasizes the study of human behavior, internal values, and decision-making processes. Decision-making is considered the heart of the organization. Three activities involved in decision-making: intelligence activity, design activity, and choice activity (details not crucial for exam). Emphasizes interdisciplinary study of public administration and advocates for public administration as a science based on universal principles. Supports the acceptance theory of authority.

* **Relevance and Importance:**
    * Integrates public administration with other subjects.
    * Provides a practical approach to public administration.
    * Highlights the importance of decision-making.
    * Promotes future research and development in public administration.


### E. Comparison: Human Relations vs. Behavioral Approach

* **Similarities:** Both emphasize the study of informal organizations and support the acceptance theory of authority.  Both focus on cordial relations between workers and management.


* **Differences:**
    | Feature                | Human Relations Theory      | Behavioral Approach                 |
    |------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
    | Study Depth            | Basic informal organization | Deep study of internal values, etc. |
    | Basis of Decisions     | Values                       | Values and facts                     |
    | Study Level            | Macro (broader)             | Micro (deeper)                       |
    | Study Type             | Primarily descriptive        | Descriptive and analytical            |


### F. Systems Theory

* **Supporters:** Herbert Simon, Chester Barnard
* **Features:** Discusses closed and open systems (interaction with external environment). Every social structure has various interconnected systems and subsystems.  If one subsystem is affected, the whole system is affected.  Open systems are affected by external ecology and environment.  Every organization should be dynamic.

* **Relevance and Importance:**
    * First theory to explain the impact of ecology and environment on organizations.
    * Supports teamwork, coordination, and cooperation.
    * Emphasizes the need for dynamic organizations, indirectly supporting change, innovation, and reforms.


### G. Structural and Functional Theory

* **Supporters:** Fred Riggs
* **Features:** Differentiates between direct and indirect structures.  Defines functions as the motives and objectives an organization sets to achieve, including direct and latent functions (intended and unintended consequences). Every structure has functions; structural and functional elements are complementary and interconnected.

### H. Case Study Method

* Popularized in the 1930s in the US.  Study of various incidents, cases, and problems of administrative organizations.

### I. Ecological Method

* **Supporters:** Riggs,  Apte. Popularized by J.M. Gaus.
* **Features:** Studies the correlation between administrative organizations and their ecology/environment.  (Example: Riggs' study comparing the administrations of the Philippines and China).
