# Public Administration Revision Module: Lecture 10 Notes

This lecture covers New Public Management (NPM) and Change Management.

## I. New Public Management (NPM)

* **Definition:** Application of private sector managerial techniques to the public sector.  It's an art of executing managerial techniques of the private sector in the public sector. Aims for efficiency, effectiveness, and economy.  Focuses on proper utilization of resources.

* **Origin:** Post-1991 economic reforms in India (and globally around 1980) led to the need for NPM due to the perceived inefficiency of the public sector compared to the private sector.

* **Key Contributors:**
    * **Christopher Hood (1991):** Coined the term "New Public Management" in his article "A Public Management for All Seasons".
    * **Osborne and Gaebler (1992):** Broadly explained the concept in their book "Reinventing Government".

* **Other Names:** Third Way, Entrepreneurial Administration, Post-Bureaucratic Model, Managerialism.

* **Key Features, Execution, and Importance:** (See Table below)

* **Stages of Change Management (Kurt Lewin's Model):** Unfreezing, Moving, Refreezing.

* **Generalized Stages of Change Management:** Identification of restraining and driving forces; planning; execution; evaluation and review; establishment.

* **Obstacles to Change Management:** Lack of communication/coordination; lack of resources; failure of past changes; lack of proper training; resistance from higher authority; lack of trust; fear of job cuts; negative viewpoints of subordinates.
