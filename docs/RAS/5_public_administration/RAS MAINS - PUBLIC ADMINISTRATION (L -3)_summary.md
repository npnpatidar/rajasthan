# Evolution of Public Administration

**Key Statement:** Public administration as a practice is as old as civilization, but as an independent discipline, it lacks a long history.

## Phases of Evolution

Six generalized phases (potential 10-mark exam question):

| Phase                     | Time Period     | Key Features                                                                                                  | Important Thinkers/Works                                                                        |
|--------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Politics-Administration Dichotomy | Pre-1927       | Separation of politics and administration as systems and subjects; Evolution from political science. | Woodrow Wilson ("The Study of Administration"), Goodnow ("Politics and Administration")          |
| Golden Age of Principles  | 1927-1937       | Development of classical organizational principles; numerous influential texts.                             | Henri Fayol (General and Industrial Management), Mary Parker Follett (Creative Experience), Luther Gulick & Lyndall Urwick (Papers on the Science of Administration), Mooney & Reiley (Onward Industry),  L.D. White (Introduction to the Study of Public Administration)                                   |
| Era of Challenge         | 1938-1947       | Challenges to classical theories; critiques of principles as proverbs.                                  | Chester Barnard (The Functions of the Executive), Herbert Simon (critique of classical principles), Robert Dahl (Science of Public Administration: Three Problems)                                        |
| Crisis of Identity       | 1948-1970       | Public administration's status questioned; near-reabsorption into political science.                     | John Gaus ("Trends in the Theory of Public Administration")                                       |
| Era of New Public Administration (NPA) | 1971-1990       | Emphasis on interdisciplinary studies; rejection of the politics-administration dichotomy; decentralization; public participation. |                                                                                                 |
| Era of New Public Management (NPM) | 1991-Present    | Focus on efficiency, economy, effectiveness; downsizing of bureaucracy; privatization; facilitating, promoting, and distributing, instead of regulating. |                                                                                                 |
