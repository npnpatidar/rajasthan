# RAS Mains Revision Module: Public Administration (Lecture Notes)

This lecture covers control over administration in Public Administration, excluding the State Polity portion (refer to Lakshmikant or other prelims sources).  The focus is on the 55 marks covered in approximately 4-5 hours across 12-13 lectures.

## I. Control Over Administration

Three primary control mechanisms are discussed:

* **Legislative Control:** Parliament/State Legislative Assembly control over civil servants.
    * **Methods:**
        * Question Hour (Starred, Unstarred, Zero Hour)
        * Half-an-hour debate (thrice a week in Lok Sabha)
        * Two-hour debate (once a week)
        * Various motions: Calling Attention Motion (since 1954), Adjournment Motion (requires 50 MPs), Censure Motion, No-Confidence Motion (requires 50 MPs).
        * Annual Report of CAG (Controller and Auditor General): Audits government spending and is reviewed by the Public Accounts Committee.
        * Financial Committees: Public Accounts Committee, Estimates Committee, Committee on Public Undertakings, Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC).
    * **Limitations:**
        * Unilateral control by politicians: Lack of opportunity for civil servants to present their side.
        * Lack of specialization among MPs/MLAs leading to superficial questioning.
        * Large size of legislature diminishes individual MP/MLA influence.
        * Questions driven by self-advertisement rather than genuine concern.
        * Nexus between ministers and bureaucrats.
        * Corruption within the legislature (e.g., Operation Duryodhan).


* **Executive Control:** Control exerted by Prime Minister, President (Central), Chief Minister, Governor, and Council of Ministers (State).
    * **Methods:**
        * Political direction by ministers in policy formulation.
        * Ministerial oversight of civil servant termination, transfer, and suspension.
        * Enforcement of the Code of Conduct (e.g., All India Services Code of Conduct, 1954).
        * Control through ordinances (Presidential/Governor).
        * Delegated legislation.
        * Control by the Finance Department.
    * **Limitations:**
        * Ministerial selection based on caste/region rather than qualification.
        * Lack of specialization among ministers.
        * Frequent portfolio changes.
        * Nexus between ministers and bureaucrats.


* **Judicial Control:** Control through the judiciary (Supreme Court, High Courts, subordinate courts).
    * **Methods:**
        * **Ordinary Remedies:** Review of rules and regulations, appeals against government/civil servants, review of delegated legislation.
        * **Extraordinary Remedies:** Writs (Article 32 for Supreme Court, Article 226 for High Courts), Public Interest Litigation (PIL).
    * **Reasons for Judicial Interference:** Lack of jurisdiction, abuse of power.
    * **Limitations:**
        * Limited number of judges.
        * Expensive and time-consuming process.
        * Overburdened courts ("Uncle Judge Syndrome").
        * Lack of specialization among judges.
        * Judicial overreach (constitutionality debates).
        * Post-mortem approach (acting after the event).


## II. Citizen's Charter

* **Origin:** Started in 1991 by British PM John Major. First discussed in India at the Chief Secretaries' Conference (1996) and introduced at the Chief Ministers' Conference (1997) under PM I.K. Gujral.
* **Implementation:** First implemented by the Food and Civil Supplies Ministry and Revenue Department (1999).
* **Elements:**
    * Public office objective/vision.
    * List of services provided.
    * Division of work.
    * Complaint procedure.
