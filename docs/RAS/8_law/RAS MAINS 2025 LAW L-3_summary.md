## Indian Cyber Law & Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)

**4. Indian IT Act Continuation & Jurisdictional Scope:**

- **Applicability:** Nationwide in India.
- **Jurisdictional Challenges:** Limited to India; needs expansion via international treaties.
- **Extra-territorial application:** Similar to Section 4, IPC; applies if Indian computer resources are targeted from outside India. Enforcement challenges exist if the perpetrator is outside India.
- **Purpose:** To define cybercrimes, provide punishments (absent before the Act), and make online legal documents admissible as evidence (broader definition in the new Indian Evidence Act). The Act covers a wide range of cybercrimes including theft of electronic information, misuse of digital signatures, and theft or purchase of stolen electronic equipment. The Act's scope is intentionally broad to adapt to future technological developments.
