## Concept of Law: Ownership & Possession (Lecture 1)

### Ownership

* **Definition:** Exclusive legal right over any property (tangible or intangible).
* **Development:**
    * Originated with civilization and settled life, replacing nomadic lifestyles.
    * Developed early in Roman and ancient Indian law.
    * In English law, the concept developed later than possession.
    * **Roman Law:**  Distinguished *dominium* (absolute right) and *possessio* (physical right). Emphasized ownership more.
    * **English Law:** Possession developed first, then ownership.
    * **Indian Law (Hindu Law):** Developed simultaneously with the concept of property during civilization.
* **Components:** Includes legal title, right of possession, and right of enjoyment.
* **Evidence:**  *Brahma Purana* (7 ways to obtain legal title); *Manusmriti* (sale as primary method of ownership transfer).
* **Types:** Absolute and Limited (Transfer of Property Act: Sale vs. Lease).
    * **Absolute:** Complete transfer of ownership (e.g., sale).
    * **Limited:** Restricted rights, temporary (e.g., lease);  the owner retains ultimate disposal rights.
* **Hindu Law:** Concept of property directly relates to ownership.
* **Ancient Classification:** Movable (जंगम) and immovable (स्थिर) property.

* **Definition:** Physical control over a property. Can be acquired through intention or physical control.
* **Savigny's Definition:** Continuing exercise of claim to exclusive control of an object.

    * **Physical Element (Corpus):** Physical control.
* **Methods of Acquiring Possession:**
    * By apprehension (taking, without consent).

* **Characteristics:**

    * Prima facie evidence of ownership (unless challenged with a better claim).
    * Considered 9/10ths of ownership (presumption).
    * Burden of proof rests on the challenger of possession.
    * Others must be excluded.

* **Types of Possession:**

    * **Immediate/Mediate:** Direct/Indirect.
    * **De Facto/De Jure:**  Factual/Legal.

### Reasons for Protecting Possession

Possession is prima facie evidence of ownership; burden of proof lies with the challenger.  This makes challenging possession difficult.

## Concept of Law: Personality

* **Types:** Living beings and artificial entities (institutions, corporations, funds, states).
* **Definition:** An entity with rights and duties recognized by law.
* **Savigny's Definition (Legal Person):** A unit or entity other than a human being possessing personality under the law.
* **Types of Legal Persons:**
    * **Corporations:**  Single (sole) or aggregate (group).
    * **Institutions:** Universities, hospitals, etc.
    * **Funds & States:** Trusts, endowments, etc.
    * **Artificial Persons:**  Entities existing only in law (e.g., paper companies).

### Characteristics of a Legal Person

* **Perpetual Succession:** Exists indefinitely, irrespective of members' changes.
* **Common Seal:**  Used for representation.
* **Capacity to Sue and Be Sued:** Requires registration, in many cases.
* **Separate Personality:** Distinct from its members; members have limited liability.


### Corporate Veil

* **Protection:**  Shields members from personal liability; liabilities belong to the legal entity.
* **Not Impenetrable:** Can be lifted by the courts if the legal entity is used illegally.
* **Consequences of Lifting the Veil:** Members become personally liable.


## Concept of Law: Liabilities

* **Savigny's Definition:** The bond of necessity between a wrongdoer and the remedy for the wrong.
* **Definition:** Holding someone responsible for their actions and omissions.
* **Types of Liability:**
    * **Primary:** Direct responsibility for one's own acts/omissions.
    * **Secondary:** Responsibility when the primarily liable party fails to fulfill their obligation.
    * **Limited:** Responsibility restricted to a specific extent (e.g., shareholder liability limited to investment).
    * **Joint:** Shared responsibility among multiple parties.
    * **Separate:** Individual responsibility for specific actions.
    * **Absolute:** Complete responsibility for actions/omissions.
    * **Representative:** Responsibility for the actions/omissions of another.


### Relationship between Legal Personality and Liability

* **Legal personality** has rights and duties; failure to perform duties leads to liability.
* **Legal personality** protects members from full liability, typically offering limited liability.  The exception occurs when the corporate veil is lifted.


## Concept of Law: Legal Rights and Duties

* Savigny: Legal rights and duties form a legal bond of obligation between two people.  (This view is not universally accepted).
