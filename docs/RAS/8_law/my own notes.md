Okay, I will perform a refined OCR focusing on the first 10 pages to improve accuracy, especially for potentially missed or misread characters and formatting. Let me process them and provide the updated OCR text for each page.

**Please note:** The goal here is accuracy, but handwritten text can still pose challenges for OCR. I will correct common errors.

Ownership

Ownership is a sum-total of possession, disposition, and-destruction which includes the right to enjoy property by the owner. It is absolute right to a thing. It is the complete & Supreme right that can be exercised over anything.

Hibbert

Ownership includes 4 kinds of rights within itself:

1.  Right to use a thing
2.  Right to exclude others from using anything.
3.  Disposing of the thing
4.  Right to destroy it.

**Page 6 OCR:**

Austin
3 attributes of ownership

1.  Indefinite user - free to use or misuse the thing in a way one likes.
2.  Unrestricted disposition absolutely free to dispose it.
3.  Unlimited Duration - perpetuity of ownership.

Criticism of Austin

*   Not a single right but a bundle of rights.
*   No residue after giving away ownership remains.
*   Not merely a right but also a relationship.
*   Right of disposition can be curtailed by state.

**Page 7 OCR:**

Jatt- Austin's Definition

The right to use or deal with some given object, in a manner, or to an extent which, though is not unlimited, is indefinite relation btw person & a thing.

Salmond

ownership vests in the complex of rights which one exercises to the exclusion of all others. It denotes the relation btw a person and right that is vested in him.

1.  Right to possess the thing which he owns. He may, however, not be necessarily in actual possession of it.

2.  Right to use or enjoy the thing owned.

**Page 8 OCR:**

1.  Right to consume, destroy or alienate the thing.
2.  Ownership has characteristic of being indeterminate in duration.
3.  Ownership has a residuary character.

Criticism

*   definition does not indicate the content of ownership.
*   not relation btw person and a thing rather person & right vested in him.
*   thing is what is owned & not the right which does not really exist.

Dicey

a person is owner of a thing when.

**Page 9 OCR:**

Holland

3 rights over object

3.  right to manage - right to decide how & by whom the thing shall be used.
4.  right to alienate or to waste, destroy or to consume whole or path of ith
5.  right to the fruits & income of the thing

Okay, I'll proceed with refining the OCR from page 11 to page 20, aiming for the highest possible accuracy.

**Page 11 OCR:**

Characteristics of ownership

1.  May be absolute or restricted
2.  Can be restricted in times of emergency
3.  not allowed to use in such a way that is injurious to others.
4.  Restriction may be imposed by law on right to disposal.
5.  owner has right to possession
6.  Law does not confer ownership on an unborn child or an insane person
7.  ownership is residuary in nature.
8.  Rights of ownership does not end with owner but instead it is transfered in heirs.

**Page 12 OCR:**

**Page 13 OCR:**

Possession

In ordinary usage, possession means having control over a thing.

Possession in law is broader than possession in fact.

Possession constitutes of two elements

1.  corpus - Control over a thing.
2.  animus - intention with respect to a thing

Sevigny

two elements which constitute possession are effective control & intention to hold as owner

does not explain possession of a thing by lending

**Page 14 OCR:**

Salmond

two elements of possession

1.  effective control
2.  intention to exclude others.

A person cannot be dispossessed of the thing merely on the grounds that he is not the owner where it is not known who the true owner is.

In possessor has a better entitlemunt to the thing againgh whole world except the true owner. no one except true owner cam challenge his entitlemen

Personality

Legal personality is an artificial creation of law.

Law attributes personality to all those entities that are capable of bearing rights or duties.
:
Company, idol, Juns, etc

Jome entities have a restricted legal personality. Like infants, Lunatics,

Law boyas enabled the meatment of the gromp as init. ay, company as a Party
