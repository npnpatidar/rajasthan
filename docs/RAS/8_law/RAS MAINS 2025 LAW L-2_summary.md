# Law for RAS Mains: Lecture 2 - Personality, Rights, Liabilities, and Duties

## 2.1 Personality

- **Types of Persons:**

  - **Natural Person:** Living beings (e.g., individuals).
  - **Artificial Person:** Institutions, companies, entities. Legal personality granted by law.

- **Definition of Personality:** An entity provided with rights and duties by law. Must be legally acceptable.

- **Samar's Definition of Legal Person:** A unit or entity other than a human being that possesses personality under the law (e.g., Hindu idol). Legal personality is conferred by law.

- **Types of Legal Persons:**
  - **Corporations:** Manage affairs; two types: sole (one person, e.g., one-person company) and aggregate (group of people, e.g., NGOs, companies).
  - **Institutions:** Larger structures established by an act of Parliament (e.g., JECRC University). Often involved in social infrastructure.
  - **Funds and Estates:** Manage assets and properties for specific purposes (e.g., trusts, charitable funds).
  - **Artificial Persons:** Entities given personality and rights/duties by law (e.g., Hindu idols, paper companies). Exist only in the eyes of the law.

## 2.2 Characteristics of a Legal Person

- **Perpetual Succession:** Exists indefinitely; continues even after death or removal of members (e.g., Tata company, JEPX). Succession via heirs or representatives.
- **Common Seal:** Identification and authentication of acts.
- **Capacity to Sue and be Sued:** Ability to initiate or defend legal actions. Registration may be required for court proceedings.
- **Separate Legal Personality:** Distinct from its members; the company's existence is independent of its members.

## 2.3 Concept of Corporate Veil

- **Definition:** A legal protection shielding members from direct liability. The company is initially held responsible; individual member liability is secondary and determined based on their involvement. Protects members from personal liability.
- **Piercing the Corporate Veil:** The court can remove this protection if the legal personality is used against the law, holding members personally liable (e.g., Vijay Mallya). This depends on the specific circumstances.

## 2.4 Conclusion on Legal Personality

- Provides collective identity to members and represents them as a single entity (e.g., a law firm).

## 2.5 Liability

- **Definition (Samar):** The bond of necessity between a wrongdoer and the remedy for the wrong. Holding someone responsible for their acts and omissions.
- **Act:** Doing something required.
- **Omission:** Failing to do something required or doing something prohibited.
- **Legal Obligation:** Leads to civil wrong (remedy often financial) or criminal offense (punishment).
- **Sources of Civil Liability:** Contract law (codified, based on the contract) and tort law (uncodified, based on precedent).

- **Types of Liability:**
  - **Primary Liability:** Direct responsibility for one's own acts and omissions.
  - **Secondary Liability:** Arises when the primarily liable person fails to fulfill their obligation (e.g., electricity bill liability shifting from homeowner to other residents if the homeowner doesn't pay).
  - **Limited Liability:** Responsibility is limited (e.g., members of a legal firm).

## 2.5 Liability (Continued)

**2.5.1 Consequences of Legal Personality:**

- Courts can hold individual members of a corporation personally liable if the corporate "veil" is lifted due to a member's wrongdoing (e.g., Vijay Mallya case). This depends on the specific circumstances; there's no universal rule. Removal of the corporate veil results in the loss of protection afforded by the legal personality, leading to personal liability for members.
- Legal personality provides a collective identity to members, representing them as a single entity in dealings (e.g., a lawyer representing their law firm).

**2.5.2 Liability (Recap and Expansion):**

- **Definition:** The bond of necessity between a wrongdoer and the remedy for the wrong; holding someone responsible for acts or omissions.
- **Act:** Performing a required action.
- **Omission:** Failing to perform a required action or performing a prohibited one.
- **Legal Obligation:** Results in civil wrong (remedy often financial) or criminal offense (punishment).
- **Sources of Civil Liability:** Contract law (codified) and tort law (uncodified, based on precedent).

**2.5.3 Types of Liability:**

| Type of Liability            | Description                                                                           | Example                                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Liability**        | Direct responsibility for one's own acts and omissions.                               | Homeowner's responsibility for their electricity bill.                                 |
| **Secondary Liability**      | Arises when the primarily liable person fails to fulfill their obligation.            | Other residents becoming liable for the electricity bill if the homeowner doesn't pay. |
| **Limited Liability**        | Responsibility is limited.                                                            | Members of a legal firm; shareholders' liability limited to their investment.          |
| **Joint Liability**          | More than one person is jointly responsible.                                          | Multiple partners in a business.                                                       |
| **Separate Liability**       | Each person is responsible only for their own actions.                                | Different departments in a university each responsible for their specific tasks.       |
| **Absolute Liability**       | Complete responsibility for one's acts or omissions; no chance of avoiding liability. | Cases arising from events like the Bhopal gas leak, stemming from tort law.            |
| **Representative Liability** | One person is responsible for another's actions due to representation.                | A power of attorney acting on behalf of someone else.                                  |

**2.5.4 Relationship between Legal Personality and Liability:**

- Legal personality entails rights and duties. Failure to fulfill duties (omission) leads to liability.
- Legal personality protects members from complete liability, offering limited liability (e.g., corporate veil). Exceptions exist where the veil can be lifted (e.g., individual member wrongdoing).

**2.5.5 Legal Rights:**

- **Definition:** Rights recognized and protected by law. Interests protected and recognized by law. A power to legally bind someone to do or not do something.
- **Theories of Legal Rights:**
  - **Will Theory:** The will or intention of the person is the major element of the right. Supported by Austin, Holland, and Pollock.
  - **Interest Theory:** The interest of the person is the major element of the right. Rights can exist without will (e.g., rights of children, lunatics, corporations). Supported by Ihering.
- **Elements of a Right (according to Salmond):** Inherence, incidence, duty, subject-matter, content, and title.
- **Types of Legal Rights:**
  - **Positive/Negative Rights:** Positive rights demand action; negative rights demand inaction. (Examples: Duty of loyalty to the state vs. prohibition against littering).
  - **Real/Personal Rights:** Real rights are against the whole world (e.g., ownership); personal rights are against a specific person or group (e.g., lease agreement).
  - **Perfect/Imperfect Rights:** Perfect rights have a legal remedy; imperfect rights do not (e.g., breach of contract vs. moral obligation without legal recourse). Imperfect rights can become time-barred due to limitation acts (statutory time limits for legal action).
  - **Proprietary/Personal Rights:** Proprietary rights have monetary value; personal rights do not (e.g., property ownership vs. reputation).
  - **Heritable/Unheritable Rights:** Heritable rights pass to heirs after death; unheritable rights are limited to the lifetime of the holder (e.g., perpetual succession vs. copyright).

## 4. Further Classification of Legal Rights and Duties

This section builds upon the previous section's categorization of legal rights, expanding on specific types and their relationships with legal duties.

### 4.1 Further Types of Legal Rights

- **Real vs. Personal Rights (Re-emphasis & Example):**

  - **Real Rights (Rights _in rem_):** Enforceable against the whole world. Example: Ownership of property (seller's absolute ownership transfer in a sale). After a sale, the new owner has rights _in rem_ against everyone.
  - **Personal Rights (Rights _in personam_):** Enforceable against a specific person or group. Example: Lease agreement; only the tenant and landlord are involved.

- **Perfect vs. Imperfect Rights (Re-emphasis & Time Barring):**

  - **Perfect Rights:** Have a legal remedy (e.g., breach of contract).
  - **Imperfect Rights:** Lack a legal remedy (e.g., moral obligation). Can become time-barred due to limitation acts (statutory time limits). Example: Failure to sue within a legally defined period.

- **Proprietary vs. Personal Rights (Re-emphasis & Clarification):**

  - **Proprietary Rights:** Possess monetary value (e.g., property ownership).
  - **Personal Rights:** Lack direct monetary value but still exist (e.g., reputation, respect).

- **Heritable vs. Unheritable Rights (Re-emphasis & Examples):**

  - **Heritable Rights:** Pass to heirs (e.g., perpetual succession, property inheritance).
  - **Unheritable Rights:** Limited to the original holder's lifetime (e.g., copyright â€“ lasts for the author's lifetime plus 60 years).

- **Rights _in re propria_ vs. Rights _in re aliena_:**

  - **Rights _in re propria_:** Rights over one's own property.
  - **Rights _in re aliena_:** Rights over another's property. Example: Easement rights (e.g., right to sunlight or airflow across a neighbor's property).

- **Principal vs. Accessory Rights:**

  - **Principal Rights:** Independent and exist on their own.
  - **Accessory Rights:** Dependent on another right.

- **Public vs. Private Rights:**

  - **Public Rights:** Belong to the state.
  - **Private Rights:** Belong to individuals.

- **Fundamental vs. Constitutional Rights:**

  - **Fundamental Rights:** Essential for personal development (detailed examples not provided in transcript).
  - **Constitutional Rights:** Provided by the constitution.

- **Vested vs. Contingent Rights:**

  - **Vested Rights:** Certain and immediate; no conditions required (e.g., inheritance after death).
  - **Contingent Rights:** Dependent on a future uncertain event (e.g., receiving an inheritance if a specific condition is met).

- **Legal vs. Equitable Rights:**

  - **Legal Rights:** Recognized by common law.
  - **Equitable Rights:** Based on equity principles; deal with shares, debentures, etc. and are subject to change.

- **Jus ad rem vs. Jus in re:**
  - **Jus ad rem:** Right to acquire something (possession is not provided).
  - **Jus in re:** Right in a thing (possession is provided). Example: Mortgage types where possession is or isn't transferred to the lender.

### 4.2 Types of Legal Duties

- **Relative vs. Absolute Duties:**

  - **Relative Duties:** Correspond to a specific right of another person.
  - **Absolute Duties:** Do not correspond to a specific right (e.g., refraining from harming others).

- **Positive vs. Negative Duties:**

  - **Positive Duties:** Require action (e.g., duty to pay taxes).
  - **Negative Duties:** Require inaction (e.g., duty not to harm another).

- **Primary vs. Secondary Duties:** (Already covered in a previous liability section).

  - **Primary Duties:** Independent duties.
  - **Secondary Duties:** Dependent on primary duties (e.g., duty to compensate for breach of contract).

- **Legal vs. Moral Duties:**
  - **Legal Duties:** Enforceable by law.
  - **Moral Duties:** Not legally enforceable (e.g., charitable giving).

### 4.3 Relationship Between Legal Rights and Duties

- **Correlation:** Legal rights and duties are correlated; one rarely exists without the other. The existence of a right implies a corresponding duty on another. This is a well-accepted fact amongst jurists.

- **Exception:** Not all duties have correlated rights (absolute duties exist). Example: Fundamental duties of a citizen (respect for national symbols, etc.). These are obligations, but don't directly translate into a specific, reciprocal right.

- **Salmond's View:** Legal rights and duties form a legal bond of obligation between two persons (or entities, such as a person and the state). This relationship is shown in the Maintenance of Senior Citizens Act, where children have a duty to care for parents in exchange for eventual inheritance.
