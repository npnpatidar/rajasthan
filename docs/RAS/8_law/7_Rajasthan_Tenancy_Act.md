# Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955

**1. Introduction:**

* Act passed on 14th March 1955.
* **Objective:** Consolidates and amends laws related to tenancy of agricultural lands and provides for certain measures of land reform.  Aimed to address issues of unequal land distribution and unfair payment to tenant farmers prevalent during that time.

**2. Chapter 1: Preliminary Definitions:**

* **Agricultural Year:** 1st July to 30th June.
* **Agriculturalist:** Person whose livelihood is derived from agriculture, including horticulture, cattle breeding, dairy farming, poultry farming, and forestry development.  The definition is broad and encompasses various agricultural activities.
* **Bhumidar:**  In the Bhumidari system, the owner of a village or a portion of a village, recorded as such in revenue records.
* **Estate:**  Includes land or interest in land owned by Jagirdars, Bhumidars, Zamindars, or Land Owners.  Interest can refer to partial ownership.
* **Ijara/Theka:** A farm or lease granted for rent collection.  The area is called the Ijara/Theka area; the recipient is the Ijaradar/Thekedar (tenant).
* **Khudkasht:** Land in any part of the state personally cultivated by a state holder.  This includes two scenarios: (a) land owned but in another's possession, and (b) land owned and personally cultivated by the owner.
* **Shayar:** Payment (rent) for the use of resources like grazing land, wood fuel, fruits, water, fishing rights, and even uncultivated land.
* **Subtenant:** Person who holds land from a tenant. The subtenant pays rent to the tenant, not the landowner.
* **Nal:** Payment in cash or kind to the owner of a well for its use for irrigation.

**3. Chapter 2: Khudkasht**

* **Khudkasht Rights:**  Not transferable except by gift, exchange, or inheritance.
* **Transfer:**  Khudkasht rights are not transferable through sale.  Exchange of land is permitted, possibly with additional cash payment to equalize value.  Partition is also allowed.
* **Abolition of Estate Holders:**  Upon abolition of the estate system, Khudkasht holders become Khayatdar tenants.  Bhumidars and Zamindars become Malikians (owners), subject to the Act's provisions.

**4. Chapter 3: Classes of Tenants**

* **Four Types of Tenants:**
    * **Malikians (Owners):**  Former Jagirdars/Zamindars who became owners after the abolition of the Zamindari system.
    * **Khudkasht Asami (Tenant):**  A tenant who cultivates Khudkasht land.
    * **Khayatdar Asami (Tenant):**  Tenant whose name is registered as an account holder in government accounts.
    * **Gair Khayatdar Asami (Tenant):**  Landholder whose name is not yet registered.
    * **Subtenant:**  Tenant who leases land from another tenant.

* **Restrictions on Tenant Rights:**  Khayatdar rights do not accrue to tenants holding land temporarily.  No rights are granted in areas under government control, such as:
    *  Pastoral Land (grazing land)
    *  Cantonment areas (military bases)
    *  Railway boundaries
    *  Municipal trenching grounds (waste disposal sites)




**4. Chapter 3: Classes of Tenants (Continued)**

**4.1 Transferability of Tenant Rights:**

* Tenant rights are inheritable (pass to heirs upon death) but generally **not transferable** to other parties.  This is because tenants only possess the right to *occupy* and cultivate the land, not full ownership.
* **Exceptions:** Exchange of property is allowed, but not outright sale.  The exchange might involve another property plus additional money if the values are unequal.

**4.2 Abolition of Zamindari System:**

* Abolition of the Zamindari/Jagirdari system resulted in former Jagirdars/Zamindars becoming *Malikians* (owners).
* *Khudkasht* tenants (cultivating their own land) became *Khayatdar* tenants (registered in government records).  *Khayatdar* tenants gain certain rights.


**4.3 Classes of Tenants:**

* **Malikians (Owners):** Former Jagirdars/Zamindars who gained ownership after Zamindari abolition.
* **Khudkasht Asami (Tenant):** Cultivates their own *Khudkasht* land.
* **Khayatdar Asami (Tenant):** Tenant registered as an account holder in government records.  Possesses specific rights under the Act.
* **Gair Khayatdar Asami (Tenant):** Landholder whose name is not yet registered in government records. Lacks the rights of a Khayatdar tenant.
* **Subtenant:** Leases land from another tenant.

**4.4 Restrictions on Tenant Rights:**

* **Temporary Land Holdings:**  *Khayatdar* rights do not apply to tenants holding land temporarily.
* **Government-Controlled Land:** No rights granted on land under government control, including:
    * Pastoral land (grazing land)
    * Cantonment areas (military bases)
    * Railway boundaries
    * Municipal trenching grounds (waste disposal sites)
    * Land under shifting or unstable cultivation
    * Land in riverbeds (due to alluvial/diluvial changes)
    * Land within government forests


**4.5 Chapter 3A: Confirmation of Rights**

* This chapter details the confirmation of rights for certain subtenants and *Khudkasht* tenants upon payment of compensation.
* **Compensation:** The amount payable for confirmation of *Khayatdari* rights depends on land type and improvements:
    * Unirrigated land: 15 times the land's value.
    * Irrigated land: 20 times the land's value.
    * Improvements made by the tenant: Compensation for these improvements is also payable.
    * Use of another's well (*Nalaba*): 10 times the land's value.

**4.6 Chapter 3B: Restrictions on Land Holdings**

* **Ceiling Area:**  Similar to EWS (Economically Weaker Section) income limits, a ceiling area restricts the maximum amount of land an individual can hold.  Exceeding this limit results in penalties.  This section also discusses government facilities provided to different landholding categories.

* **Tenant Interests:** A tenant's interest in their holding is inheritable but not transferable.
* **Restrictions on Transfer:**  Tenants cannot sell, gift, or place their land holdings in trust.  These actions are restricted because they do not own the land.
