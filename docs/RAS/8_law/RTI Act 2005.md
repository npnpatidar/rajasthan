**Amendment Implications (Reiterated):**

*   **2019 Amendment Bill (Term of Office and Salaries):**
    *   This amendment gives more control to the Central Government in determining the terms of office and conditions of service of the Information Commissioners.
    *   Critics argue that it undermines the independence and autonomy of the Information Commissions and potentially weakens the effectiveness of the RTI Act.

*   **2013 Amendment Bill (Political Parties):**
    *   This amendment aims to shield political parties from the transparency requirements of the RTI Act.
    *   Critics argue that it weakens the RTI Act and prevents citizens from accessing information about the functioning and finances of political parties, which are integral to the democratic process.
